You know how they say that a mother has so much adrenaline pumping through her system when her child is in danger that she can just about lift a car off of it?  When I saw those two desecrating my queen-sized air mattress in the corner, I got so worked up that I could have taken that mother and her child, locked them up in the trunk of that car, and tossed it onto the roof of of the self-storage facility around the corner, the one with the orange hangar-style doors.  That's three stories high.  Anyway, the two fled out the back door and I went into a rage.  I broke everything in the house that reminded me of her.  The toaster-oven she used to make me pepperoni bagel-bites for breakfast each morning, the ironing board that we trimmed the legs down on so that it could double as a coffee table during that Pawn Stars marathon last July.  After about 45 minutes, I was totally drained from breaking stuff.  I took the truck down the road to the Citgo station to refuel and got a sleeve of those mini-powdered donuts and a Redbull Zero because my doctor says that too much sugar will make my Diabetes flare up.  It's a lot less syrupy than the regular Redbulls, but it definitely perked me back up.  On the way home, that Mr. Mister song about Broken Wings came on and I knew it was a sign because my heart was broken and Redbull gives you wings.  At that point, I knew I had to forgive her.  We've been happily married for 8-months now with a little one on the way, and I can honestly say that without Redbull Zero, I may have never gotten up the courage to patch things up.

Xanthan Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />Xanthan Gum is used to modify the viscosity of liquids, on a very low scale (typically 1/3 tsp per 1 gallon). Because of the difficulty in combining Xanthan Gum to a liquid evenly, you should mix this into your liquid very slowly, in a blender at full speed, and it should be one of your steps (before adding other ingredients, including Guar Gum).<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Xanthan Gum and sometimes Guar Gum (also available from Barry Farms: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC5M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution (again, mix in slowly via blender running on high), but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is the secret to making softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Another interesting characteristic of Xanthan Gum is its ability to thin out when subjected to forces such as shaking (called shearing), which makes it great for poured sauces, as it will thicken back up after having exited the bottle. It can also prevent oils from separating from liquid-oil emulsions (think salad dressing). It is also more stable under a wider range of temperatures and pH than other gums.<br /><br />Xanthan Gum can also be used to give dough the stickiness that is needed in gluten-free baking, as gluten is usually what gives that sticky characteristic to dough. And no matter the use, Xanthan Gum will always remain colorless and flavorless, so it can be used for just about any need that suits it."

Only other time ingesting anything ever did something like this was when I thought I would just go ahead and throw the beet stems in my juicer to be ""extra healthy."" I am not allergic to beets, but beet stems made my eyes run green snot. This stuff produces almost as bad a reaction. So... throwing away the full $18 bottle when I get home."

Did not think it would work, but have noticed a vast difference in fat loss. I take it with every meal consisting of balanced proteins, carbs and fats. Sometimes if I go overboard and overeat I definitely make sure I use it before I engage in a heavy meal.I now have a lot of loose body fat particularly around my waist and upper back area. I look forward to going to the gym to do my cardio and toning excercises to tighten up the loose skin. This juice has definitely made a difference in losing my ab fat. This was my most difficult area to lose. I am a size 10 at the top but wear a size 4 in skirts and pants. Obviously my most stubborn and difficult areas are my abs, back and upper body.I like the taste of this particular brand. I did try another brand but did not like the flavor as much as I like this one. That's the only reason I am able to continue using because the flavor is great. I will continue to use this brand until I reach my goal of fat loss. I've tried alot of products but this seems to be working the best for right now."

Not that it tastes horrible, but like most contests between similar products that are sugar-based and sugar-free, the recipe for which you already have a preference is going to win despite the competition's particular and sometimes overwhelming merits.  Since I've decided to limit my sugar intake but not my affection for margaritas, this tequila mixer is best suited to take care of the problem, so I've decided to stick with it and learn to like it.  Over time I've at least grown accustomed to the taste (adding extra Triple Sec helps), even if I can't say it's the best improvement to margaritas since the salt rimmed glass.  Splenda certainly works better in some things than others.  In this case it's a qualified success with taste taking a subjective second place to functionality.  I don't love it or hate it, but I don't miss the sugar either.  To that end Baja Bob's Margarita Mix does what it's supposed to do very well."
80090,80091,B0000D9589,A15WSQFDTKGGDH,Jeff Lindborg,3,3,5,1246060800,Good margarita mix - other flavors noted in review,"As a type 2 diabetic I've always resigned myself to drinking just straight scotch or bourbon when imbibing on occasion as mixed drinks are loaded with carbs and the few sugar free ones either weren't so much carb free (""sugar alcohol"" from maltatol or the like) or they tasted just awful. I tried the original Margarita mix from Baja Bob and was very pleasantly surprised by how great it was. I then went a little nuts and ordered 1 of just about every flavor offered off their site (not all flavors are available on Amazon but they are a few bucks cheaper here than off Baja's site directly when you order in sets of 3). Here's the short rundown on my take:<br /><br />The lime margarita mixes (both the original and the Key Lime) are fantastic - both blended with ice and on the rocks they hold their own with any Margarita mix I've tried. I prefer the original since it's a little more ""tart"" the way I think a lime margarita should be in my book. For folks here that complain about it being too limey they may want to try the key lime - it's a little milder.<br /><br />The strawberry margarita mix was ok - a bit sweet for my taste but to be fair I'm not really that big of a strawberry margarita guy to begin with.<br /><br />The Pina Colata mix was very good and even my wife liked that one as well and she _never_ partakes in cocktails with me. Note that there are around 4 carbs per serving with this instead of the usual zero for the rest of their mixers. The coconut cream in the mix has a few carbs - but totally worth it. Creamy and smooth blended with ice in a good blender. Very nice.<br /><br />The mojito mix is decent. I can make a pretty passable sugar free mojito myself but this is pretty good. I probably wont bother to stock up on it because it's not a must have mixer for me.<br /><br />All the martini mixes were just awful in my book. Other folks seem to like them, maybe it's just not my thing.  The apple and cranberry tasted like medicine to me and I promptly tossed the rest of the bottles after the first taste. The lemon was pretty poor and I gave it a couple shots before throwing the rest out.<br /><br />I didn't care for the hurricane mix and tossed the rest - but again, to be fair I'm not really a hurricane fan to begin with so I'm not necessarily a good judge on this one.<br /><br />The sweet and sour mix made a nice whiskey sour. Not the best I've had by any stretch but perfectly servicible in my book.<br /><br />Finally the Mai Tai was pretty good - Not my favorite drink in the world but this was as good as any I'd had.<br /><br />So they're batting around .500 give or take. Definitely worth picking up a few bottles and testing out - I think some folks that are skeptical, particularly about the margaritas and pina colatas will be pleasantly surprised."

A letter to Lipton 6 years ago gave no explanation for not marketing in the US, just ""coupons to try our other brands"".

From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT ""foil-wrapped for freshness"" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).

After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is ""insipid"" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan."

Tea flavonoids can also improve your body's immune system.<br /><br />I normally find this green tea most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I heat the water until it's almost at a boiling point; then I put the water and the tea bag into my cup. I let it steep for a few minutes before I add milk and one packet of ""sweet and low."" It's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality green tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking--hot summer's day. Pick some up and try it--you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SMILE"

That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there."

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011)."

Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny."

It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous."

I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily.

Seriously, all other waffle mixes just taste like sand to me, but Mrs. Butterworth's is so sweet and tasty. I've eaten Mrs. Butterworth's since I was a kid, so that may be part of it, but since I've introduced my fianc&eacute; to this mix, he can't seem to get enough of it, so it must not just be me. And it's SO easy to make - a touch of vegetable or canola oil, some water, and a waffle iron is all you need. No eggs, no milk, nothing perishable that you might not have on hand at the moment.<br /><br />What I can't understand is why none of my local stores seem to carry this mix anymore. Pinnacle Foods is apparently still making this mix, but no one seems to carry it in my area. I wonder if that's because of the ""contaminated"" scare that went around when people first started noticing the brown sugar crystals scattered through the mix and assumed that the evenly distributed, dissolves-in-water, brown crystals were a contaminate of some kind. Honestly, it seems that everything has to be bleached white as a ghost these days, ruining all the flavor and nutrients, and introducing goodness knows what chemicals into your system before people will eat it. And now even Amazon doesn't seem to carry it, which breaks my heart.

Within a few weeks he was covered in bumps from head-to-toe, his hair fell out, he wheezed horribly, had really bad gas, went to the bathroom a lot and had loose stools.  I wasn't sure he would live, and the Vet said he had severe allergies, probably to his food, and put him on several months of prednisone and a prescription allergy food.  I was upset with the prednisone treatment as I knew it was dangerous and my dog hated the prescription food.  Two weeks later there was almost no change and he was still miserable, so I started researching my own solution for allergies, comparing food ingredients, and ideas to try.  I found that salmon/fish and sweet potatoes are not ingredients found in many other dog foods so an allergy to them would be more rare...and this food doesn't contain any grains or poultry products.  I started him on this and added a heaping spoon of canned pink salmon with it, and he still licks the bowl clean every time.  His breathing started clearing up within a week or so and I was able to stop giving him prednisone.  The bumps gradually went away after about a month and a half and his hair slowly grew back.  It took about 4+ months for 100% of his symptoms to go away, but he has been doing great for over a year now.  (For treats he is only allowed raw baby carrots, apple chunks, frozen green beans, or salmon jerky.)<br /><br />This food is an excellent option for dogs with both grain and poultry allergies as I can't seem to find another quality dog food that doesn't contain a little bit of chicken or rice, eggs, oatmeal, etc.  My only issue is that it is a bit low on protein, but since I add canned salmon to his food each day anyway isn't a problem for us.  The canned salmon and salmon oil are good for his skin so it works nicely, especially since he will eat the dry dog food just fine, but when I add the canned salmon he goes nuts for it.<br /><br />If your dog has allergies, try this!!

On the second to last bag, I end up throwing out several cups of kibble because she'd let it sit there for an entire day (and she's fed twice a day).  Though I store the food in a tupperware container, it seemed like my dog was snubbing it because it wasn't fresh.  With the next bag, she excitedly ate the first few bowls... and now we're back to the same thing. She'll let it sit there for hours. I sometimes have to put treats in it just to get her to eat it. Maybe this food doesn't keep well?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this kibble has a noticeable fish smell which is detectable on her breath.  Also, I've noticed in the last month or so that my dog has had TERRIBLE smelling gas. Maybe that's just middle age catching up with her, but it's got to be at least somewhat related to what she's eating!<br /><br />So overall, I give this three stars.  My dog is one of the most food-motivated creatures you've ever met. Having food she won't eat is just frustrating!"

He was losing weight and went from 75 pounds to 57 pounds before we found out the cause. I contacted the food company who were no help at all.  They didn't even respond to my reply.  I wasn't asking for any miracles, I just wanted some answers and I got a big fat NOTHING.<br /><br />After switching vets my new vet discovered the yeast infection and we switched the dog food.

She was on Wellness before and the vet switched her to a special canned food.  Then he had me switch her to Science Diet Sensitive Stomach.  She did fine on the canned food, but got sick with the Science Diet.  Once I started this food, she stopped getting sick.  It was a miracle!  Her gas has gone away and she has kept the food down for over two months.  I'm so happy with this food!  I switched her brother onto the food too, and they both love it."

The breeder had him on Science Diet which I've read is not a very good food.  I tried putting him on Blue Buffalo LBP but could never get consistently firm poops.  After reading the reviews I decided to give this brand a try.  Since switching, my pup has consistently good stool in the morning and afternoon, but for some reason by early evening, his stool is still soft (although not a runny as when he was on Blue Buffalo).  The reason I'm giving this a 3 star is that 1. This particular blend smells very fishy.  If you don't mind fish breath on your dog then its not a big deal.  2.  The first ingredient is not a protein thus the protein levels are lower than other premium dog foods.  This may be OK for an adult dog, but I'm not so sure if this is enough for a growing pup.  Which leads me to #3.  You need to feed almost twice the amount of food for growing puppies (probably to make up for the lower levels of protein).  In the end you are actually paying more since the serving size is larger for puppies; also larger serving size means more poop to scoop!  My dog is 8 months old so I might just weather out the next few months on this brand until his growth slows down then try to switch to Taste of the Wild.  I most definitely will not be getting the fish blend again, its too stinky. I may try the bison mix next."

These weren't even worth the price at 57% off list.<br /><br />Normal version:<br /><br />I purchased these when there was a deal a few weeks ago, and have been brewing both espresso and drip coffee with them and a caffeinated variety by the same company.  This review is for the Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Decaf Espresso.<br /><br />The first thing to say about Larry's Beans is that they are all packaged quite well in individual boxes which contain the air-tight bag of beans.  This makes them easy to stack in a warehouse, and also prevents warehouse employees from inadvertently slicing open the bag when unloading a crate or larger package.<br /><br />When I received the beans, I immediately fished out some freezer bags and prepared to portion out the beans.  I opened the sealed bag and the beans smelled OK; the smell wasn't overpowering but it was not what I would consider ""gourmet.""  It's not old or musty smelling like some of the other ""gourmet"" decaf bean roasters represented here on Amazon, but it's also not top shelf.<br /><br />Although the beans are evenly roasted, I would definitely not call it Espresso roast.  The roast is more reminiscent of a mild breakfast roast - medium brown, not the dark black I expect when I think of espresso.  Also, the beans are very small - clearly not a premium batch of beans.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to accurately represent the style of roast, and for the beans to be large, although uniform in size.  Neither were the case with these beans.<br /><br />When portioning the beans into 1lb freezer bags, I found that the beans really aren't oily at all.  I surmise that this has to be due to the water process used to decaffeinate the beans, although I don't know this to be a fact.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to be oily enough to leave a clear film on the inside of the freezer bags I package them in, and this didn't accomplish that feat.<br /><br />As you can see, the initial impressions of the look and smell of the beans were only mediocre, not outstanding like the price should suggest.  Now, on to the flavor.<br /><br />Fresh out of the 5lb bag, I hand-ground enough of the beans for a couple of shots of espresso.  Yes, I have a counter-mounted hand grinder that can also be used to make flour from grains!  Anyway, I ran the ground coffee through my pump espresso maker, and what came out the other side had no crema, although the shots themselves didn't taste horrible.  The flavor was reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, with astringent, grapeskin-like qualities that struck me as quite bitter for the mild roast.<br /><br />I have since made pots of drip decaf with this bean, and combined it with a caffeinated version from Larry's Beans, and it's passable (carried by the excellent quality of the caffeinated beans, I'm sure), although still not what I would consider worth the price.  I haven't found any excellent decaf beans on Amazon, yet, so I will move on to another variety once this batch is gone."

Plus, this is way cheaper than buying those rice bran face masks from Japan.<br /><br />I also use this as a partial substitute for flour in baking. It's very nutritious and causes my cookies to spread out a little flatter (maybe because it reacts differently to the baking soda?), but the taste of the cookies is not affected and I like crispy edged cookies.<br /><br />I also sprinkle this on white rice since this is the vitamin-packed part of the rice before the rice is processed. I sprinkle it in other dishes too, especially ones that require a little thickening. Overall this is a great product and I'd buy it again!"

For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one.

However, Nutro was especially hit by the nasty recall episode from a few years back where a number of pet food manufacturers had contamination issues, and they eventually pulled their pouches. I tried a bunch of canned foods afterwards, but my cats never warmed to any of them like they did the pouches.<br /><br />Wellness came out with their ""healthy indulgence"" line of pouch foods not too long ago, and interestingly the packaging is pretty much identical to the Nutro products, down to the notches to facilitate tearing. I can only imagine that they are using the same manufacturing facilities as Nutro did, but hopefully with a superior product. Everything I've read about Wellness suggests that they make high-quality pet foods. My cats seem to love these as much as they did their old pouch foods. They have now been eating pouch foods almost daily for at least 6-7 years, so I don't have any major concerns about long-term health issues.<br /><br />Overall, these pouches are great. Each single pouch is one serving for one cat, so the costs do add up fast if you have multiple cats and serve this twice a day. I give dry food in the morning and the pouches at night to help conserve costs, but they always finish the Wellness pouches within a half hour, whereas the dry food often sits around unfinished all day. Another plus is that no spoons or forks need to be involved, since you just tear each pouch and shake the contents into the bowl.

I opened this matcha and was pleasantly surprised to smell chocolate!  I couldn't seem to smell the raspberry in it.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh, if it'll make it very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I really wasn't sure how I wanted to prepare this matcha.  First I prepared it with just 1 tsp matcha and 16.9oz of water.  It was ok, but not really what I was looking for.  I seemed to get more chocolate from it this way and not enough raspberry flavor.  SO, next I heated up some milk, added a bit of sugar and frothed it up into a latte.  Now here is where I get more of the raspberry.  It's a nice creamy truffle.<br />On a side note, I'll be learning to make truffles from tea as a local tea shop this week so maybe I'll be able to use what I have left in making a tea truffle!  You can never go wrong with chocolate and raspberries that don't make you gain weight.<br />THANKS again Red Leaf for another wonderful matcha creation....keep'em comin'!<br />To get your own tasty Raspberry Truffle Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]"

It tastes like a rasberry truffle and the lingering taste after you drink it is exactly like the lingering taste that is left when you eat an actual truffle.  Besides the great taste Red Leaf has terrific customer service!

80521,80522,B008ADQYYU,A29P51TN9KKMU9,Azzrian,0,0,5,1347062400,Wow how do they do this?,"My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding! I had this matcha latte shake concoction over 15 minutes ago and I am still tasting raspberry chocolaty goodness in my mouth!<br /><br />Of course as always Red Leaf Tea's matcha base is outstanding!"
80522,80523,B008ADQYYU,ATAF98JNSVCPM,MRawlins2,0,0,5,1343606400,"Great, intense flavor!","As I was considering which flavored matcha I would try next from Red Leaf Tea, I was stumped. There are so many amazing flavors! However, this Raspberry Truffle matcha caught my eye fairly quickly and I knew that I had to give it a try. I am a sucker for all things chocolate, particularly super rich truffles of all flavors. I had very high expectations for this matcha and I have to say that it more than exceeded my expectations! You can find out more about this matcha here: [...]<br /><br />Once again, I was very pleased by the intense aroma as I opened the package. I could have sworn that somebody just opened a very expensive box of raspberry truffles somewhere in my kitchen. The matcha was a very bright green color despite being flavored. I first tried this traditionally as a hot bowl of matcha in my chawan. Initially, the slight bitterness of the matcha hits your palate, but it is followed by an intense and slightly sweet raspberry flavor with the chocolate aspect occurring more in the aftertaste. I love how the aftertaste lingers several minutes after your last sip and I also appreciate that the matcha was very easy to whisk with no noticeable clumps. While this is a super awesome way to drink this matcha, I just had to try it as a cold latte since it is so unbelievably hot here in Texas.<br /><br />For the cold latte I added a healthy scoop of this Raspberry Truffle matcha and milk into a blender bottle and shook it all up. Once again the matcha blended beautifully without any clump which is something I've noticed in other matchas when preparing them with a cold liquid. Although I didn't add any sweetener, the matcha seems a little sweeter now, but not by any means overly so. I also think that the flavor profile is a bit more balanced at this temperature. The bitter edge of the matcha is almost non-existent and the raspberry and chocolate flavors are more unified as a raspberry truffle would be. It is quite refreshing on this hot day and I was impressed that it didn't settle out even after being left on the counter for 10+ minutes.<br /><br />Overall, this is another big success from Red Leaf Tea! Not only is the tea quite tasty, their customer service is amazing. My order arrived within 2 business days! If you haven't tried anything from this company, you are missing out!"

The flavor is deep and savory, like a peppered oregano and something you just cannot put your finger on.  Musky and warm, it is pungent and cozy.  They are used from Spain to Pakistan.  If you have had them, it is most likely in string cheese, often from Armenia.  If you are from New York, they were frequently used in stead of caraway in rye bread.<br /><br />If you are a baker, try studding your crust with them, especially if you are using an egg wash.  Nigella love all starch, pasta, potato, rice and bread.  As before, they also fancy cheese.  If you cannot find Armenian string cheese, there are several domestic ones made without the seeds.  But they tend to be on the krafty side.  Trader Joe's may be the best of that lot.  Or go to your mexican market and get Oaxaca cheese, the kind you stuff chilies with, which is a good place to use them since they go with tomato sauce.  Middle Eastern halloumi or akawi work well.<br /><br />Or, go with farmers' type curded cheeses, whole milk cottage will do.  Just warm a spoon of seed in virgin olive oil until it hits your nose, but do not use high heat or you will burn the fat in the oil.  Cool and stir into the cheese.  Crumbled feta or blue are good.  Let it sit overnight or so if you want, just take it out of the refrigerator for an hour or so to bring it back to room temperature.<br /><br />Switch out the pepper for Nigella in your next ratatouille.  My favorite:  use a table spoon of seed in two of oil and two of butter, warm as before and fold in 200 grams or so of gorgonzola (dolce is decadent) and toss with a hot pot of your just drained fettuccine or pappardelle or even black squid ink pasta.  Just do not be too zealous in draining.  Some pasta water is nice.  Add a spoon or two if that is easier.  Garnish with fresh oregano, marjoram or basil.<br /><br />Prefer rice?  Use feta and kalamata olives or feta and small shrimp with blanched spinach.<br /><br />Get to know this seed.  You might see them labeled as charnushka.  Zamouri is a first rate source of highest quality and freshness."

I do, however, buy it here and buy it often as I donate it regularly to my church for their special dinners for the homeless, those in need, and fundraiser suppers.<br /><br />The pastor tells me that those who do the cooking for the church, as well as those being served enjoy it a lot and many ask for 'seconds'. The pastor advises me it makes a great side dish and helps to fill up hungry tummies  while being so easy to make. On occasion, the church cooks will add their own additional onions and celery, but it isn't necessary as this stuffing includes all that and more. And,because this is a 'herb' flavor, adding chicken stock or turkey stock vs. water makes it even more complimentary to a chicken/turkey meal.<br /><br />The price here at Amazon is better than that at the local grocery stores, esp. with my Prime for free shipping. I can also get it in 1-2 days if the church needs extra with short notice. Good deal, good product, prompt service.<br /><br />Edit: 2-25-10 (after-thought). All one needs to add to this product is butter and water. Depending on how moist/dry one prefers stuffing, simply add more/less water. Our church roasts turkeys and hen turkeys in large quantities very often and we strain and freeze the 'au jus' from them in 12 oz plastic containers. Occasionally, rather than using up our butter supply for stuffing, we substitute the defrosted au jus from the turkey. This seems to be the preferred 'flavor' by those enjoying the meals."

My husband, though, actually prefers this over my (sometimes) labor intensive homemade stuffing so I like to keep a quantity of it in the house for him. Making this according to the directions isn't something I've ever done so I can't really comment on that but I can say that with a quick few additions and substitutions, I can actually eat and enjoy this as well.<br /><br />First, I always use stock (usually chicken/duck -- whatever I have in my freezer) instead of water and add some sort of vegetable to it as well. Usually it's sauteed, grated carrots or zucchini but I've put everything in it at one point or another. I also add to the seasoning with whatever I think will taste good (sage is always great as well as any sort of chicken seasoning and I always add parsley if I have it fresh on hand).<br /><br />Here are some more suggestions to add to make your stuffing better that I've tried and liked:<br /><br />-- Cooked sausage -- breakfast sausage is always good but I've used brats and italian sausage as well and it's equally as good.<br />-- Bacon<br />-- Chicken livers (or turkey or duck or whatever you might be cooking)<br />-- Ground beef<br />-- Or you could go the fruit way and add apple, dried cranberries, raisins or even substitute some of the water for cider<br />-- Nuts (chestnuts and walnuts are what I've used)<br />-- Veggies -- Like I said above, grated carrots or zucchini is my standby but I always add onions, garlic, and sometimes celery or mushrooms as well.<br />-- Cheese -- parmesan in particular<br /><br />I also have a friend who swears by adding white rice to it as well but I haven't tried it (and personally think that that's an awful lot of carbs!)<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer has said, this is a fantastic donation item because it's easy to make as well as being very filling.<br /><br />Nutritional Information (1/6th of the box or 1/2 cup prepared stuffing):<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Calories from Fat: 50<br />Total Fat: 1g **<br />Saturated Fat: 0g **<br />Trans Fat: 0g **<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Total Carb: 21g<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Vitamin A: 8%<br />Vitamin C: 0%<br />Calcium: 0%<br />Iron: 6%<br /><br />** (plus whatever butter you use)<br /><br />*** Contains both wheat and soy"

If you own a hotel type 4 cup coffee brewer like the Jerdon First Class, these work far better than trying to use #2 cone filters. Cone filters aren't meant to be used in hotel type round pouch brewing containers, the cone collapses and some grinds leak out.

May go off insulin completely soon. Thank you Fancy Feast. Please read full review below to learn why you should start feeding your cat (even if healthy) only Fancy Feast Classic Turkey, Chicken, Beef, or another WET food that has practically no plant based ingredients and has less than 10% of the calories from carbohydrates.<br /><br />Even if your cat isn't diabetic please read this review and the wealth of information by a vet at catinfo.org. My 12 year old cat was diagnosed with diabetes about 2 months ago. He is a big cat and about a year ago he weighed 22 pounds. Two months ago we noticed that he looked thin, so we took him to the vet. They discovered that he had lost 7 pounds (a third of his body weight in one year), was walking on his forepaws, and based on this checked his blood glucose. It was around 450, which is more than 400% higher than the normal level of less than 100.<br /><br />The vet followed the normal procedure for treating diabetic cats: insulin and ""prescription"" cat food (Hill's MD, dry). She did talk me into Lantus insulin, which is new (and more expensive), but has a chance of stimulating your cat's beta cells to start producing insulin again.<br /><br />We started my cat on 3 units of insulin, twice daily. I fed him the exact amount of Hill's I was supposed to. Came back for checkup a week later, glucose still off the charts. Up'd insulin to 4 units twice daily. Recheck: still through the roof. Up'd insulin to 5 units. At this point wife and I started reading online and found wealth of info at catinfo.org by a vet who specializes in treating diabetic cats. This vet is a crusader of sorts against the horrible diet we feed our cats. Cats are obligate (strict) carnivores. This means there diet should be almost 100% protein and fat, from animal ingredients. Your cat should have no more than 10% of there calories from carbohydrates. DRY FOOD, OF EVEN THE BEST QUALITY, CONTAINS MUCH MORE CARBS THAN YOUR CAT SHOULD HAVE. We discovered the Hill's food we were feeding had about 17% carbs (the canned version is about the same, so don't be fooled).<br /><br />After doing much comparison, we settled on Fancy Feast Classic Turkey & Giblets, because: (1) has only about 6% calories from carbs (2) first ingredient is turkey, other ingredients are liver,  by-products, that is, proteins & fat (3) it is sold everywhere, unlike high end canned foods (4) it is less expensive than high end canned foods (5) unlike the Fancy Feast Classic chicken or beef, it has no fish. Looking at (2) you may think ""eww...by-products,"" but for a cat, animal by-products, which are protein and fat from an animal, are better than plant based proteins and much better than carbs. Looking at (5), cats should not be fed fish very often, because the trace amounts of mercury in fish will build up in your cats body over time. But if your cat won't eat the Turkey, the chicken or beef would be the next best options. Make sure it is the CLASSIC style, as the other Fancy Feast brands have too many carbs.<br /><br />Back to my cat. So now we were up to 5 units of insulin, twice a day. Recheck: glucose still above 400. I tell my vet that we are switching to Fancy Feast and she agrees to keep insulin at 5 units. Recheck a week later: GLUCOSE LEVELS COMPLETELY NORMAL! Go down to 4 units, twice daily. Recheck: still normal. Down to 3 units, twice daily. Still normal.<br /><br />We are now down to 3 units of insulin, once a day. There is a good chance he will be off the insulin completely in the next few weeks. My cat has gained 2 pounds, has stopped drinking water and urinating constantly, and acts four years younger. Another bonus, on the expensive dry food we used to feed him he would throw up almost every single day. Now he only throws up occasionally when he has a hair ball. We also now feed are 18 year old cat this food only. She seems much more spry and happy.<br /><br />I know this is just one anecdote (although there are more on the web) and that the Lantus insulin may be the real reason for this turn of events, but I do believe personally that it was Fancy Feast that saved my cat."

My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin. He progessively got worse, as the insulin doses steadily increased. My super smart, very litter trained cat got completely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br /><br />At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.com. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br /><br />I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some concerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly couldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br /><br />I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. (Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly recommend this food for the health of your cat.<br /><br />Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of 3 cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to cover up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have covered them and allowed them to retain their moisture."

We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not ""goopy"" nor does it leave ""rice-sludge"" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.<br />We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.<br />We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It contains DHA to boost development.<br />-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.<br />-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).<br />-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.<br /><br />Cons<br />-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).<br />-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."

Gerber's DHA/Probiotic rice cereal has a very long ingredient list, I think because of all of the vitamins it is fortified with. Well, that is fine. Wish it were more basic, but ok.<br /><br />My son loves ""normal"" rice cereal. With this DHA rice cereal, he will tolerate it, but he definitely noticed the difference. He kind of scrunches up his face. Today his made a gagging face and acted like he was going to throw it up. I don't know if that is because he doesn't like the weird flavor or what.  I tasted it too, and I can't stand the fishy sense I get when I eat it. It isn't a strong or overpowering fishy flavor, but there is definitely a weird aftertaste going on. You can still notice it when you mix in fruit or sweet potatoes to try and cover it up.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish the can we started. Back to the other brand for us. Bummer, Gerber. Wish they could use algae based DHA rather than Tuna oil."

Nope, she does not like it mixed with water or milk.  It does not mix well with soup.  Since it has a mild sweet taste to it, it will ruin the flavor of the soup.  She is picky, what can I say.<br /><br />Finally, after many tries, we finally figured out a way to feed her the cereal:  mix the cereal with formula/milk; pour into a pan and warm it up on the stove; while heating it up, stir constantly to ensure they are mixed together; once well mixed, let it cool and then pour into bottle to feed.  I had to cut the silicone nipple in order to accommodate the thick liquid.<br /><br />We feed her this mix once or twice daily.  As she grows, formula/milk alone do not last as long as they used to.  To keep her stomach content, night time feeding is essential, so she does not awake from hunger in the middle of the night.  A bit of work, but I think it is worth it."

This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil."

It definitely has essence of fish. I tried his other rice cereal before too. It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin. It was really frustrating to me to mix up. I'd get it to what I thought was a good consistency and a few minutes later it would turn into this runny mess, sort of like paste. Awful!

He came to me two years ago from a rescue group who transports black dogs from the southern U.S, where black dogs have a very high kill rate, to the nortern U.S. to be adopted. He was about 5 yrs old at the time I adopted him, sight unseen, from Arkansas.  Severe alleries were included among the miriad of issues that afflicted him. This manifested itself in runny eyes, full body skin yeast infection resulting in what the vet termed ""elephant skin"" on his abdomen, throat, elbows, and haunches.  Also bald spots over his neck, throat, thighs, and toes from constant scratching and biting at himself. In many places the ""elepant skin"" was perpetually split/cracked, infected, and bleeding.  After treating the bacterial and yeast infections with both topical and oral agents which did clear up the bacteria but left the yeast as a chronic secondary infection of the allergies, I searched for other remedies.  Along with seasonal, environmental, and other allergies to dust, fabrics, vegitation, etc. I also found a lot of good information about food allergies.<br />Taking this information into consideration I scouted around for an ""allergenic"" kibble that was made by a company that has never had a recall, does not do animal testing, provides appropriate nutrition, and is somewhat affordable. Wysong seemed to fit the bill. Anergen has been a key part of Kobe's allergy treatment program for the past year.  Along with ""therapeutic baths"", Ketokonazole lotions, hydrocortisone lotions, diligent laundering of doggie coats/bedding/linens (no wool), and oral antihistamines Kobe's skin is soft and smooth without splits/cracks/infection; his bald spots have shrunk to half the size; and his eyes only run occasionally.  He still does scratch and bite at himself intermittently. I notice this usually happens when I deviate from the Anergen diet, giving him rawhide chews, beef bones with marrow, or cookies (organic) with mixed ingredients.<br />I don't really know what else, short of steroids, can be done to help him. I have avoided steroids due to their own detrimental health effects. Anergen seems to be the food solution to his allergies, which is a good thing! I add water to the kibble and let it sit about 10 minutes to form a kind of ""gravy"".  He likes this better than the straight dry kibble and it also helps to keep him hydrated.<br />Note: My other dog, a 9yr old husky-shepard mix eats Wysong Maintenance and is strong and svelt; and the cats eat Wysong Uretic."

The company sent no announcement of the size change via email (I am on their mailing list). I think the consumer at least deserves an explanation.

It's also completely filling and satisfying.<br /><br />I'm pre-diabetic and so far seem to have elevated blood sugar only in the mornings, so this may not be relevant to people with full diabetes, but here are the results of my tests. An evening meal including a double portion of Dreamfields and 30 grams of carbs from another dish gave me a modest rise in blood sugar, about what I'd expect from a 40-50 gram meal. On another occasion when I ate a double portion of Dreamfields alone in the late morning, my blood sugar had dropped slightly six hours later. I had read a couple of people complaining that they got high readings eight hours or so after eating Dreamfields but this doesn't seem to happen to me.<br /><br />Extra fiber is always another plus. With the lowered carbs Dreamfields should also be lower calorie but there don't seem to be any official claims for that.<br /><br />Again according to my readings: don't overcook it, reheat it, or cook it in something acidic like tomato sauce or the carb-hiding effect will be lost. (It's fine to add tomato sauce after the pasta is cooked.)<br /><br />The only drawback is the price, but it's well worth it to be able to eat pasta and not be concerned about the carbs."

So I asked and they later confirmed that yes you are actually putting 190 calories in your mouth, but I guess you have to accept their opinion that you only will absorb 129. I keep a journal of all calories, so do I document 190 or 129? If it was only 129 why would they be required to put 190? To me it sounds like a game, the same game they appear to be playing with the carb count. Unless it is otherwise univerally accepted by the scientific community I say it has 190 calories."

I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that ""practice makes perfect"".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni.

You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture."

The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie."

The soup is so simple that even an elementary school child should be able to prepare it.<br /><br />While the soup is relatively low calorie (190 calories), as with many soups it does have a fair amount of salt, with 850 mg of sodium.  If you eat few other foods with much salt, this soup could be a perfect balance.<br /><br />Maruchan Chicken Ramen has been and continues to be a family favorite.

It's amazing. (It's also quite tasty, kinda like Snapple only if you drink too much you turn into Rip Van Winkle.) A family member recommended it and I'm glad I tried it. I wish it wasn't so expensive and more available though. Often, Amazon is out of stock and nowhere else on their website is listed as a seller.<br /><br />Update: I've noticed that since I started drinking this every once in a while when I have sleep issues, even if months have lapsed at a time, I've become more tolerant to the effects of the drink. (I found this, also, when I took Valerian pills directly. Valerian root is one of the ingredients.) So one bottle or two doesn't really put me to sleep anymore. This might just be me but I'd suggest not using it too often to avoid becoming tolerant. Just use it when you really need it...which I do but I tend to become tolerant to things very quickly. I wouldn't mind if the cost wasn't so exorbitant. Drinking two bottles a night can become pretty pricey if I'm having a week of insomnia. The thing is despite the price this does really beat the side effects of a lot of the sleep aids out there and trust me, I've tried A LOT of them. This is great for once in a while when your sleep schedule gets out of whack.<br /><br />Also, I discovered that Walmart sells the drink for $20! And it ships free if you purchase more than $45 so it's worth going over to Walmart to get 3 cases at a time."

It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling.

Connely,3,3,5,1275436800,A Happy Dog is a Green Dog,"My wife and I share our home with the Three Muske-Terriers: A male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. The Empress is alergic to wheat, (along with corn and soy), so I had my doubts concerning Pet Greens Roasted Chicken Recipe w/ Wheat Grass Dog Treats - wheat grass after all is just ""juvenile"" wheat. But apparently not to worry! We're half way through our first bag and no allergic reaction, (you haven't lived until you've seen a crazed Scotty in the middle of an allergic frenzy chewing on her tootsies). Now, putting aside her allergies, the Empress will eat almost anything - and so will the Cesky. But the Westie gives new meaning to the term ""finicky"" - and Asta gives these treats five barks - I mean, stars. So what's up here?<br /><br />The treats are mostly roasted chicken meal, supplemented with dried chicory extract, organic ground wheat grass powder, lecithin, salt, cultured whey and garlic, preserved with ""mixed tocopherols,"" (I'm not a chemist, but I think that's a fancy name for vitamin E, sourced from vegetable oil). The wheat grass doesn't contain any wheat glutten - which I think is the reason it doesn't trigger the Empress' allergies. Wheat grass is an excellent source of any and all of the nutrients contained in fresh vegetables.<br /><br />The treats are small ""jerky-like"" rectangles - no more than an inch by 3/4s of an inch, and maybe 1/16 of an inch thick, (they may be more appropriate for small to medium size dogs - a large dog would want three or four at a time). They're great for a quick reward and at only about 4 calories a piece, there's not much danger that your dog is going to put on unwanted pounds, (however I wouldn't suggest that you carry them loose in your pocket or purse - they smell strongly of garlic - I keep 'em in a zip lock baggie).<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the ingrediants are all natural, but only the wheat grass is organic - if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you check out those made by Wagatha or Robbie Dawg.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I think that Pet Greens offers both a change of flavor and a change in texture from most common dog treats. The Three Muske-Terriers are scarfing 'em down - your furry buddy probably will too."

The only problem - not really a problem just an observation - is that once her fingers get wet the melts tend to stick to them and she has some difficulty getting them from her fingers to her mouth - she generally ends up with several stuck to her head and behind her ears (not unlike the rest of her food I suppose).

This food (and we do buy these in the set of 8)was and continues to be a lifesaver.  When nothing else would do, our baby LOVED these. I will say that they are on the expensive side compared to what you can get in the grocery stores and ""big-baby-chain"" stores.  We compared these to the GERBER yougurt melts and I believe there to be a noticible difference in quality/ taste, with these coming out on top. In the begining when she was just starting solids she would eat bunches of these on her own. They melt very quickly and for us, there was never a concern for choking (or puking with the overactive gag reflex).  Our baby is older now and can eat a lot more table foods, but we still mix these in with other puffs, cherrios, and small cereals for her to eat as a mix.<br /><br />I have purchased three orders of these from amazon (and enjoy amazon prime shipping)- so will likely purchase again, would recommend to a friend, and would buy (in smaller portions) as a gift for other moms to try out."

Spritz with EVOO, oven bake as you usually do for oven fried chicken. While the chicken bakes, put 4 T. coconut oil on a cookie sheet and place on empty, lower rack in oven. Slice 5 washed yams in 1/4 inch diagonal slices. Remove the warm cookie sheet and toss yams in melted coconut oil. Return yams to oven. Yams will be done about the same time as chicken...but check so they don't become mushy. You will love this chicken, if you love cinnamon, and the yams are better than candy. Hope it makes your day."

Kelloggs has decided to change how many calories are recommended each day for an adult.  They changed it from 2500 to 2000.  Why. What do you think. I can think of at least three reasons.

I think they could put five times as much tuna in the giant jar and it shouldn't affect the price a bit because you'd still be paying the equivalent of $30 per pound!<br /><br />The cat loves them though and I guess that's the bottom line.  But they stink!  I made the mistake of touching them to pull them out of the bottle.  I should have just sprinkled them out.  Now my hands smell like tuna!<br /><br />But the cat LOVES them.  And it's so good to see my 16-year-old cat really enjoy something and get so intense about it!  It's like they took 10 years off her life!  She's SO happy today!!<br /><br />WARNING:  One word of warning though... don't put the bottle anywhere where you don't want the cat to go.  The odor is quite strong and it leaks out of the bottle.  In other words, the cat can smell the bottle from a mile away!  Do NOT put it on a shelf, desk or counter if you don't want the cat to go there.  They will do anything in their power to get close to the bottle!!<br /><br />I don't like my cat getting on my desk.  And if I put the bottle on my desk that would instantly become her new favorite place.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing... the cap was impossible to get off the first time.  I had to actually take a knife and cut away at the little tabs that you have to break in order to open it.  But after opening it the first time it's been fine.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because I hate the smell and because of the difficulty in getting the top opened initially.  But it's definitely a 5 Star + for the cat!  And that's what counts."

What I received instead<br />was a blue mylar-fused zip-top bag. Those are harder to seal and keep fresh,<br />in my experience.<br /><br />Then the item itself. Sure, I read the reviews. At some point, food and treats are<br />food and treats, and you hope your cat will eat them. Well, count two cats here who<br />could not care less!  I shook some out on the floor. Both looked at me like I had<br />littered, and missed the trash can! There was cautious sniffing and walking away.<br />I ended up having to vacuum it up off the floor later.<br /><br />Now, I know it is a myth that cats adore fish. It's a cute story, and the fish bones<br />are just so darned cute when the graphic artists draw things about cats. The truth is that<br />most cats prefer some sort of poultry, and eat birds and mice - not fish. Few cats live<br />in the water, and even fewer own fishing rods! ;  )  They do not regularly attempt to eat<br />fish. (They do, however, love trying to catch the small ones in aquariums, just like they<br />would like to catch any moving object.)  My bad for not remembering that fish is at the bottom<br />of a cat's food choice list.<br /><br />What a waste this purchase was!<br />I can't recommend it at all. It was smelly, the cats ignored it,<br />and I definitely did not appreciate getting a different item than was pictured.<br />I wanted the one I thought I was buying based on the picture, not a substituted ziploc bag.<br />Seller should notify buyers of the difference and offer to cancel the order."

I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.

You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium.

I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute.

Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving.

My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering.

They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!"

I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!"

It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older.

It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12."

The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their ""BOLD"" line. Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>.

It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!"

I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite.

Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.

This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion.

Jenkins,1,1,5,1203292800,Great Dog food for dog's with kidney disease,"My dog was recently diagnosed with kidney disease and the vet recommended the k/d diet.  I bought a 5lb bag at the vet's office for $32.00 of Hill's Prescription K/D dry dog food.  The vet told me that there were different brands and I'd have to experiment to find out which one my dog would like.  Not knowing that I would need a prescription for such dog food I went home without a prescription.<br /><br />My dog seemed to like the food - so knowing that a 5lb bag wouldn't last long I went in search of this special dog food. I went from store to store trying to find the k/d diet dog food.  I quickly found out I would need a prescription - of which the vet had to mail to me.  Even with the prescription you can only buy this special dog food from a vet's office.  Well for me - that's totally inconvenient.  My vet's office is a 1/2 hour drive away and with my work schedule and kids - it's not always convenient to drive for an hour just to get dog food.<br /><br />At one store I found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet food which could be bought without a prescription.  The clerk there was exetremely knowledgable and helpful.  She told me that the Hi-Tor Neo Dog food was actually better than the Hill's Prescription k/d.  I thought I  would try it since the 10lb bag was $24.99.  My dog loved it!  The clerk told me that they might not carry this brand for much longer so I went on the internet and found that Amazon carries this product. Even with shipping I'll be saving more than half of what I would spend at the vet's for a 10lb bag - not to mention the cost of gas and my time for a round trip.  I compared the labels and I do believe that Hi-Tor is actually better than the prescription brand.  In short, it's better for my dog, my dog likes it, I don't need a prescription and it's half the price with more convenience than the other dog food - what's not to love about it?"

I figure just because I want cold tea doesn't mean I have to reach for the Lipton bags. I am a fan of most Harney & Sons tea. When you open the tin the aroma of pomegranate is very strong and pleasant. I really enjoy just smelling the tin for a moment. Unfortunately, the love stops there. When brewed you get a very strong taste of the Ti Quan Yin oolong which I honestly don't know how it differs from other oolongs but they said the leaves are Ti Quan Yin so I'm rolling with it. I don't really taste the pomegrante and overall I feel it's a bit bitter. I tried it with agave as well and while it tamed the oolong a bit, I still didn't get that fruity note that I was looking for. I think I'm glad there are only 6 bags to go through on this. I may even try brewing 4 cups of hot water (they recommend 2) and steeping 2 bags in a 2-quart container. I'd rather ""waste"" a bag experimenting than to toss it aside and let it go stale.<br /><br />I think this one is probably a pass overall.<br /><br />I will say my tin was perfect, which is nice because it's pretty and reusable."

However, I tried it again and I've developed a newfound appreciation for what they have here.<br /><br />It is rare to find a true french roast in a consumer branded coffee.  Most of what is called a french roast is really a full city roast (sometimes not even that).  The difference is stark.  However, I blame Starbucks for giving me a taste for a full french roasted bean.  And that is at least partially what you get here.  I'd estimate the blend at about 40% full french roast and the rest ranging from full city to full city roast +.  The net effect is a strong cup of coffee that, yes, will taste a bit scorched if you aren't accustomed to it.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for that same high octane kick that you get from Starbucks coffee then this may be the way to go.

Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know.

From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones.  I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Amazon as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident.  I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside.

The taste is light, refreshing and hardly sweet at all. And yes, it is thirst-quenching. However, I do not recommend this larger packaging size. The other tetra packaging for the smaller individual cartons is better equipped for impact. Since I lost much of the drink from the leakage on both orders, I cannot give a high rating. However, I will give credit where credit is due and Amazon has been prompt to respond to my concerns."

Each box came in at different times, with different UPS tracking numbers. So I had to make sure I was home on different days, and had to keep track of each package. One package was damaged in shipping. UPS reported the damage, and I was reimbursed. On the rest of the shipment (11 separate packages), some of the individual VITA Coco 34 oz boxes leaked.  The aluminum seal is not very strong, and caused the coconut water to leak in several boxes. The seal in the 11 oz package of VITA Coco is bigger and stronger than the seal in the 34 oz package.  I would never have this item shipped again, unless they change the packaging. I think the leak was not the fault of UPS, but the fault of VITA Coco packaging.

On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged.

Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others.

I have tried this variety (Vita Coco) and the Zico brand, which were comparable in price and quality. Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion. So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold. As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories. One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more). The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.

The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."

Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)"

The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and ""best"" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  ""Reilly"" recommends the treat!"

This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie.

It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that."

It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, ""lightly"" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.

Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.

The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is ""All-Natural with Vitamins,"" that there is only ""1 calorie in every 10 licks"" and that there are ""over 500 licks per bottle.""  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week."

One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs.

So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product.

If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed.

The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though.

The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options."

I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.

He would get very frustrated when he would get a taste of the gravy, but couldn't lick hard enough to turn the ball.  He finally gave up on it & asked for another kind of treat.  DJ loves it but thought only 20 or so licks wasn't enough & also asked for something more substantial.  I guess it would be good as a treat when training a dog to do tricks or potty train.  It would be a nice reinforcement.  I also like giving the dogs a treat to keep them busy for a while, but this treat takes up my time, as I have to hold it.

It looked like you pealed the wrapper off the lid area, but it wasn't coming.  Then I could see the faint perforated line around the base of the cap and you twist to break that, like a salad dressing bottle.  The stick itself is like a deodorant roll-on. Seriously.  The instructions say to shake it up before offering.  This stick was a ""chicken flavor"".  I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.  If you put it up close to you, it is strong, so I just kept it down at dog level.<br /><br />This is a very odd way to give a treat to a dog.

After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point."

I like that the ingredients are all natural and there are no ""iffy"" ingredients.  To top it off my picky raw fed dogs love this stuff.  I'm keeping it as a training treat only to keep it special for them.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan on buying lots more!<br /><br />ETA:  I would caution against using this with totally unruly dogs.  If you think your dog would rip it out of your hand and chew it up enough to dislodge the ball I would not use this product as the ball *could* be a choking hazard.  I have pit bulls and they could tear this container apart in 2 seconds flat but they are well trained so I know they wouldn't. I would also caution against leaving it laying around where an unsupervised dog could get at it for the same reason.

The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the ""lick but don't bite"" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors.

However, you aren't supposed to ""give"" your dog the Lickety Stick, which works like a roll-on deodorant, the human holds it while the dog licks it. If your dog reacts like Rocky, you'll get a big kick out of it.

She loved it and caught on very fast!<br /><br />If you're looking for a treat you can give to your dog and then walk away, this isn't the one. You have to hold it so that he/she can lick it; they cannot eat the plastic part. I think it's a great treat for training. It's easy to carry around and ""operate"" (uncap, tilt, hold in front of dog). I'm using it to teach my dog simple things...she's learning to stay right now, and so I tell her to sit, I walk away, and when I let her come to me, she gets a few licks. It works like a charm!<br /><br />Of course there's the chance that your dog may not like the flavor or might try to chew the bottle instead of licking it.

It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better."
81796,81797,B005CUU25G,AID8OJP77VK6Y,Terry T,1,3,2,1338940800,Pros and cons...,"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."

Although it's low in calories, it's easier and cheaper just to use a few of the dog's kibbles for treats, subtracting them from the dinner allotment if calorie count is an issue.  If your pet doesn't eat kibble but you still want to give treats, I don't think this offers anything that any other tiny treat doesn't offer.  It's actually less convenient to hold the Lickety Stik for your dog to lick than it is to just toss a treat.<br /><br />Also, the first ingredient listed (this is the Savory Chicken flavor) is ""natural chicken flavor.""  Do a little reading and you'll quickly realize this doesn't necessarily mean an actual chicken was involved anywhere in this product.  Aside from that there is cultured lecithin (I have no idea what the ""cultured"" modifier means in this context), vitamins E and C, rosemary extract, and green tea extract.  None of this sounds harmful, but none of it sounds particularly nutritionally helpful, either.<br /><br />As far as dogs' opinions, we had an even split at my house.  Both dogs thought it smelled good and eagerly licked it initially.  One dog has not only refused it since that first taste, but actually pulls back from it when it's offered (and this is a dog that eats anything -- animal, vegetable, mineral, paper towel, cardboard...).  The other is happy to lick from it until I take it away.  I'll probably let her continue to use it until it's gone, but I don't see myself adding more of it to my pet-treat cupboard."

Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star."

My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think ""Lickety Stik"" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions (""give a lick"" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless."

This is the new wave of dog ""treats""??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole ""Likety Stik"" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the ""Likety"" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the ""Stik"" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say ""ewwww get this thing outta my face right now""!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit."

There was only small hint of the smell of bacon left behind.  If you need a product to keep your dog occupied than the Lickity Stik would work but it does not seem to do anything but encourage your dog to lick.

This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container. The idea seems to be that you just have the dog lick it directly off the roller ball.  This plan happens to be a poor plan.  The roller ball doesn't roll freely.  So, I wind up sticking my fingers on the ball to help it roll--thereby getting nasty liver smells on my hands. I do have the liver flavor only; I *thought* Vine was sending one of each flavor, but we just got liver, so my dog has only ""taste tested"" this one flavor.  She approved heartily of the taste.  Scored big wags.  These are low cal, but unless your dog is on a particularly restricted diet, she/he should be able to spare a few calories a day for treats (there are several 2-10 calorie per treat options out there, like Zukes and Mother Hubbard Minis.  Good old fashioned green beans make good, all natural, dog treats, too).  If it dispensed more easily, I would have given this  four stars instead of only two.  But the combination of it's oddity and having to finagle the roller ball with each use lost it at least one star.  Personally, I rate it two stars; my dog however gave it five (she basically likes food in general, though, and she's never met a treat she didn't like)."

The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic.

Walker ""BookLoverAzleTexas""",0,2,1,1317859200,what a strange idea,"Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it."

Gibson,0,3,3,1317686400,"Interesting product, but I'm not quite sure what to do with it","I am only reviewing the bacon flavor (was supposed to get 3 different flavors, but only got one).<br /><br />The good news is that my dog went crazy over this.  He absolutely loved it!  I have literally never seen him get this excited about a treat.  Unfortunately, that is also the bad news.  Because he loved it so much, and because he got so excited, it was a pointless exercise trying to get him to just lick the top.  He would take a lick or two, then he would start hopping and jumping, and trying to grab the entire bottle out of my hand.<br /><br />I have 11 and 10 year old daughters, and they normally love giving the dog a treat.  They won't give him this anymore, because it gets the dog hyper excited, and he starts jumping on them trying to get the treat out of their hands.<br /><br />So......whatever the ingredient inside the bottle is, my dog loves it, and I suppose yours will too.  The only question is the delivery system.  Maybe its not the best idea to have a treat that is meant to be held like this one is.  It assumes that your dog will sit quietly while you hold the bottle and he licks the top. No way that will ever happen with my dog.  He looks at it as he does any treat....he thinks it is meant to be taken and eaten.<br /><br />I debated on giving the product a 3 (because I don't think I will ever buy it for the reasons noted above) or a 4 (because my dog loves the flavor).  Ultimately I gave it a 4.  If my dog loves it, how could I give it a 3.<br /><br />**Update 10-5-11**Despite the fact that my dog loves the taste of this thing, I took it down to a 3 star rating.  Nothing really has changed, except for the fact that I am finding this to be more of a pain than I originally thought.  It was a novelty at first, but now I am weary of fighting the dog over this thing and trying to keep him from biting and chewing it (and creating a choking hazard or a mess).  Can't recommend it.<br /><br />**Update 10-9-11**I feel foolish writing another update on this product, but this is my last one.  My dog has gotten the hang of using this product, and now does a pretty good job of licking versusing chewing.  Also, this is one of his favorite treats. I am surprised, because my dog loves to chew, so I would have thought that a licking treat wouldn't hold much interest for him.  I am now thinking I would buy this product again ***but*** not at an $8 price point.  Way too expensive, relative to what you get.  The package says you get 500 licks.  In about 30 seconds, my dog get in 10-15 licks.  He does this twice a day, so this thing is not going to last 3 weeks at my house.  For me to buy this, it would have to be in the $2-3  price range.  I have to imagine that if they can sell deoderant in this price range (and this thing is identical to roller ball deoderant), then they can sell liquid dog treats in this price range."

What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled ""Savory Chicken Flavor"". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it ""Savory"" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me."

You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it.

Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests.

This works well, except that we don't feel comfortable giving her treat after treat after treat. Then, along came the Lickety Stik, and it solved our problem! Our puppy LOVES this, and it's become an invaluable training tool. We have bought several in different flavors and keep them in different rooms around the house. When our puppy is doing something she shouldn't be doing, we give her the appropriate command (""Off,"" ""Wrong,"" ""Leave It"" etc.). If she does what she's asked, we say ""Good Girl!"" grab the Lickety Stik, and she gets a couple of licks. This has worked amazingly well, and we're not stuffing the puppy with treats. There are some times when we feel she'll continue the bad behavior just to get a Lickety Stik, but that's the same with any treat. To solve this, once we know she understands the command, if she continues to do the behavior, she doesn't get the treat. She soon realizes that to get the Lickety Stik, she has to not do the behavior at all.<br /><br />Of course, your dog may be different, but this has been our experience.<br /><br />Also, my daughter is working at a local pet store as a grooming assistant, and she tells me that they have started using the Lickety Stik there to help calm their dogs and curb bad behavior while they're being groomed.

I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it."

Give your dog a treat by offering a lick or two of a bacon flavored liquid he or she will like. Take the cap off the bottle and there is a large ball similar to a roll-on deodorant ball - offer it to your dog and he'll lap it up. This appears to be an actual roll-on deodorant container that has been repurposed for this product. The problem is that the ball doesn't rotate freely. Our dog can't make the ball turn with his tongue. When I roll it with my thumb so he can get more, I have to go wash my hands as the liquid is brown and sticky. So - a mediocre rating because the product IDEA is good, but the container doesn't work well."

I saw this Lickety Stik and the concept seems good.  I had read some reviews about certain dogs not liking this product at all but that is not the case with my beagle.  In fact, she LOVES this stuff and will sit near the counter staring up at it.  My only issue with this product is that it really stinks....and I mean really stinks!!  I try to quickly open it, let my beagle take a few licks and then close it as quickly as possible.<br /><br />It works very similar to how a roll on deoderant would work so if you haven;t used it for a few days, it may take some manual intervention to get the top of the ball wet enough to turn on its own.  I don't have any issues as my dog can easily get it started using her tounge.<br /><br />I will most likely try the other flavors of this since my dog likes it so much.

These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats."

The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.

I can't speak to the taste, but I feel like I'm giving them puppy crack because they became very upset when I put the stick up.<br /><br />As a human, I'm a little less enthused about the whole thing.  First, it's more like a bottle of shoe shine than a bottle of deodorant.  So, as you turn it upside down, you have to squeeze the bottle a smidge to bring the liquid to the ball.  Squeeze too hard, and your dog will get a face full of Lickety Stik juice.  The dog doesn't mind, though.<br /><br />Both dogs started to try to chew the bottle.  They sort of got the hang of it, but I'm not sure that I'm giving them a life lesson here or anything.  It's certainly not worth the patience, for instance, used in showing a toddler how to drink from a straw.<br /><br />Still, as a novelty, I'm cool with this.  I really do think the dogs will get militant when the bottle runs out, though.  For all I know, it's just sugar water, but whatever it is, they really like it."

It's mostly stuck in one position unless I manipulate it with my fingers (which are then covered in a strongly-smelling liquid that is difficult to wash off).  My two dogs quickly figured out what to do with this ""treat"", and they will lick and lick, but nothing comes out unless I either (1) squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out (which then usually drips onto the floor) or (2) move the roller ball with my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept that needs a little tweaking in the execution."

Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog.

By the time I had the bottle out of the envelope, the Rottweiler had joined us.  Their anxiety grew as I struggled to break the plastic wrap around the top.  Finally I had the bottle ready for action, after a very long 30 seconds.<br />I had to rub the roller ball to get the liquid inside to lubricate the ball.  Squeezing the bottle forces the liquid to ooze around the ball.  Both dogs wanted to eat the bottle rather than lick the ball.  They give it a five-star review and suggest that the Vine program send more to our house.<br /><br />The rottie still wants to eat the bottle. The cocker has learned the licking technique.  The cocker is quite responsive to the sound of the bottle being shaken. (Cockers are the original foodies.)<br /><br />The major problem I have is that the ball does not move freely.  I get some liquid on the ball and hold it out for the cocker.  She licks it very clean.  Then I have to squeeze more liquid out and roll the ball around with my thumb.<br /><br />The ingredients seem to be healthy, or as healthy as something with bacon fat in it can be.<br /><br />This product can be a great training reward, but you will have a sticky thumb. The first time I offered my thumb to be licked clean, the cocker started to eat it. If you are training your dog, you probably will want a rag to keep your thumb clean.<br /><br />My vine review philosophy is to first test the product without regard to price.  Now that I have checked the price, currently around $8, it seems a good value for a training tool.  $8 does not buy a decent size bag of training treats.  And the dogs are much more responsive to the bacon than to freeze-dried lumps.  However as just a treat for being a good dog in general, it is not as satisfying as a regular-sized biscuit.

The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split."

DORONIO,1,2,3,1341878400,These things stink!!,"I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it."
81898,81899,B005CUU25G,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,MyPenName,1,2,2,1328400000,Somewhat undecided,"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""

81901,81902,B005CUU25G,ASF0R1CMSF26F,A. Burke,1,2,3,1322697600,"Interesting, but what's the practical use?","Lickety Stik is an interesting idea. It's a small bottle filled with a thick brown liquid - a liquified dog treat, essentially - which you can squeeze out and smear over the top (sort of like gel deodorant). Your dog, I guess, is then supposed to lick this as a treat, but unfortunately my dog was just confused. I was still able to dab the liquid on his paw, and he seemed to like that quite a bit. So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy. Otherwise it seems more convenient for me (and probably for many others) to stick with the dry treats."

I love the fact that they are so crunchy. (My husband likes chewy ones, and he buys his and I buy mine). I always have some in my car in case I get hungry. That way there is no temptation to go to a drive thru for fast food! I have never seen this APPLE flavor before, and I could hardly wait to get the box from AMAZON open. There is NO flavor of NV granola bars I don't like, but this flavor became my instant second ""favorite"" (after Peanut Butter). When I eat these in the car I break the package in thirds cross wise (breaking BOTH of the bars), then I go back and break each to those sections in half lengthwise of the package. Then I split the package open the length of its seam and put it where I can reach it. By doing this I generally get 12 fairly uniform pieces and very few crumbs (which I eat later when the car is not moving). This method works well anywhere you want to eat them and definitely seems to generate far fewer crumbs.<br />I ORDERED THESE AS A SUBSCRIPTION JUST BASED ON HOW GOOD ALL THE OTHER FLAVORS OF NATURE VALLEY ARE.<br />NOTE: Another flavor I have never heard of: Vanilla Nut is listed on Amazon as ""out of stock"" with a place you can sign up to be notified when they are again in stock.

I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4  bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits.

You don't need much, but this will bring out that depth and richness you want in a sauce, thick or thin, to really taste wonderful.<br /><br />Personally, I used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies (I know, life is short, frozen is okay sometimes!) and a handful of shrimp and a block of tofu cut up. I added about 1/3 c soy sauce (kikkoman, of course!!) and a dash, probably a 1/4 teaspoon or so of Dynasty Hoisin, mixed well and DANG! That was so good!!! If you like a lot of sauce you could totally double or triple it, adding hoisin to taste.

While some dogs go their entire lives scarfing down the fun-to-chew treats, they can be deadly. Rawhides can be full of bacteria and poisons. Aside from what is in rawhide, dogs can choke on them or sustain intestinal blockage from ingesting them.<br /><br />Rawhides often come from less developed countries. This means that the hides are transported over poor roads and without refrigeration, before they cleaned and dried. Under these conditions, they can grow salmonella which can kill your dog. It is also unsafe for humans, especially small children, to handle. The problem has been so serious that in 1999 the FDA to issued a warning on the subject stating ""These products may pose a risk of bacterial infection such as Salmonella...FDA is urging pet owners who have these products to handle them carefully. Anyone who comes in contact with these treats should wash their hands with hot water and soap. Elderly people, young children, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk from exposure and should avoid any contact with these chews.""<br /><br />Read up."

At 18.6 oz can price a case of 12 of the smaller 10.75 oz cans should only cost $12.11 if the 18.6 oz cost $20.96 for a case of 12.  That is .02 cents per ounce more, buying it by the smaller cans.<br />I purchased a few cases of the smaller cans when they were on sale, then seen the 18.6 oz cans were cheaper by the ounce and bought four cases of them to try.<br /><br />WOW, was I SURPRISED. I have gone back to eating the smaller cans of the soup. The flavor in the bigger cans does NOT even come close to tasting the same as the soup in the smaller cans.  Why that is I have no idea. But I find the flavor of the smaller cans MUCH more flavorful and tasty vs the larger cans.  If the larger cans contained soup that tasted the same, I would purchase the larger cans every time.  But all 48 cans in the four cases tasted the same.  Something just not quite right with the flavor.<br /><br />Personal preference I am sure, but that is part of life.  I grabbed the salt and pepper mills and added a little of each to the big cans of soup.  Nope, I couldn't make it taste as good as the soup in the smaller cans, no matter how I dressed it up.  The smaller cans needed no salt or pepper, and the flavor was/is perfect, thus I bought seven cases of the smaller cans in the past three months.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but doc it one star because of the high price.  And, yes, sometimes some of the cans are dented, but I think most of these cans, which they sell for about half of what you pay in a grocery store for them, are distressed goods. e.g. Picked up from grocery stores because they ARE dented.  A dent doesn't bother me since I am only paying about half price per can and getting it delivered for free.  Campbell's large cans of rib roast are great flavor, but that is another story/review.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6FTZO"">Campbells Chunky Soup, Classic Chicken Noodle, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"

82067,82068,B000V6FTZO,AOINAOO0NQRGN,Rooster Eberle,0,0,5,1324857600,An excellent soup with a bad rep,"It was a bit of a surprise to see how poor the reviews of this soup are. In terms of taste and texture, this chicken noodle soup is very close to the 18-ounce Healthy Choice Chunky chicken soup that Amazon also sells. And that gets five-star ratings from reviewers.<br /><br />This soup has a fairly rich and tangy chicken broth. The noodles are substantial and just about as good as canned noodles can possibly be. There are chunks of white chicken meat in the soup. There is also a hint of other vegetables (carrots, I think) in the broth. The Healthy Choice version of this soup is actually a bit more bland than this soup because the use of salt is minimized. The 10-ounce size of the can makes this an ideal choice for a quick snack, whereas the 18-ounce Chunky soups are a bit too large as a snack for one person.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The negative reviews seem to focus on three things: the soup is watery, the cans are too small, and the price is too high. Let me take these in turn:<br /><br />1. The Chunky soup line is not condensed soup. I know from other reviews that some people think it is, add water, and then complain that the soup tastes watery. This soup actually has an appropriate amount of broth as it is. That broth is fragrant and has a distinctive chicken-y taste. If you add water, though, it will taste watery.<br /><br />2. The cans are exactly as big as Amazon claims. I know some people buy this expecting the big Chunky soup cans sold in supermarkets, and these people understandably feel disappointed. I had to learn myself to be careful and check the quantity or volume with any online grocery purchases.  But as I said above, the 20-ounce cans are ideal for quick snacks. I knew I was buying something in smaller cans, and I personally found this size preferable.<br /><br />3. The soup right now is in fact overpriced at $22. The Healthy Choice 12-pack of 18-ounce chicken noodle soup costs less, around the $18-19 range. That's a much better deal. When I got this particular item from Amazon, I paid about $13. The soup is a good deal at that price. Any higher, and it's a poor deal.<br /><br />By the way, I add Parmesan cheese and baco-bits to this soup. It makes for a more entertaining treat. I hope some of this proves helpful."

I have not used this item, am just giving definition.","Non-GE - ""GE"" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be ""instant gratification"" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products"

I grind the whole flaxseeds to a meal using a coffee grinder and primarily use the flaxseed meal to replace all or some of the butter and oil in baked goods recipes.  Sounds sketchy but it really does work - in my experience, even in yeast bread recipes!  It has a very subtle, almost undetectable flavor and you'll see little flecks of the meal in your baked product, particularly if all white flour is used.  Store ground flaxseed in fridge or freezer.  Flaxseed meal has multiple health benefits including Omega-3's, lignans, fiber.  Here's how to add the meal to your baked goods (copied from Livestrong.com):<br /><br />-Add flaxseed meal to breads, muffins, pastries, cookies and other baked goods for extra nutrition and to produce a nutty flavor. According to the Barleans website, flaxseed meal should compose a minimum of 6 to 8 percent of the dry ingredients in any recipe.<br /><br />-Replace the oil, shortening, butter or margarine with flaxseed meal in any baked goods recipe at a ratio of 3:1. If a recipe calls for 1/3 cup of oil, for example, replace with 1 cup flaxseed meal. Flaxseed meal has a high oil content, but contains less fat than most oils, shortening, butter and margarine.<br /><br />-Reduce the flour in any baked goods recipe by 25 percent and replace with flaxseed meal. If a recipe requires 1 cup flour, for example, use 3/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal instead. Using flaxseed meal this way adds a slight nutty flavor and a golden brown color to your baked goods.<br /><br />-Use flaxseed meal as replacement for eggs in baked goods. Combine 1 tbsp. flaxseed meal with 3 tbsp. water for each egg and let the mixture stand for about five minutes before using in batters and doughs.<br /><br />Read more:[...]"

It is more spicy than the other ginger I have tried at restaurants, but that did not bother me.  The issue I have with this product is that the after taste is not fresh.  When I first bit into the ginger I thought it was going to be great because initially it tastes just like I remember restaurant quality ginger.  The aftertaste is the disappointment."

I was very disappointed in the quality of the ginger compared to what I get in restaurants and what I buy at the store.  The ginger was much thicker that what I considered normal and not the ""pink"" color I was expecting.  The taste also was not what I consider to be ""premium"".  Maybe I just got a sub standard batch, but I definitely would not reorder this product."
82122,82123,B001G0N5RS,AN1OK2J2TEINT,Caleb Murdock,5,5,3,1308096000,Good enough,"First, let me say that this ginger is from China, and any food from China concerns me.<br /><br />I have eaten about 30 bottles of this ginger.  It is different from the pickled ginger (gari) that you will get in most restaurants.  It seems to have been pickled for a shorter time, and it is definitely crunchier than restaurant ginger.  Also, it is hotter and less sweet, and the slices are thicker.  Nonetheless, when I eat it with sushi, I like the hotter taste because it is more flavorful (ginger is naturally hot).  When I first tried bottled gari 20 years ago, it was absolutely horrible, so I know how much worse this ginger could be.  A lot of people don't know that gari is not supposed to be eaten with sushi; it is supposed to be eaten between courses of a meal to cleanse the palate.  But I prefer to eat my ginger with sushi, and the more intense flavor suits me.  However, if I were eating it between courses, I would want a milder, sweeter ginger.<br /><br />The first bottles of Roland ginger that I ate were from a discount store, and they were a little old.  They had a slight off-flavor.  By the time I ate the last bottle (a year after I got them), the inner plastic seal disintegrated as I removed it, so you can't let this ginger sit around indefinitely.  Indeed, I think that the vinegar probably caused the plastic seal to degrade faster than it would have.  The fresher bottles that I got from Amazon have a fresher flavor, and it is definitely good enough to eat with sushi.  Unless you are prepared to make your own gari, I recommend it (although I haven't tried any other brands).<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about the thicker slices.  Restaurant ginger is sliced very thin and is limp, this ginger is sliced thicker and is firm and crunchy.  The thicker slices may be one of the reasons it is hotter, since the vinegar may not penetrate the thicker slices as well.  I had no objection to the thicker slices until I opened a bottle and found slices up to 2mm thick -- that's definitely too thick.  But for the most part, I don't mind the thicker, stiffer, crunchier, hotter qualities of this ginger.  This ginger is a little closer to being raw than restaurant ginger is, but it's good enough to eat with sushi.<br /><br />The vinegar leaked out of one of the bottles during my second shipment from Amazon, and the vinegar soaked the cardboard box.  I didn't have rice vinegar, so I replaced the vinegar with water, and the ginger tasted okay.  When I got my third shipment (on Oct. 21st), I found that the bottles were sealed in a plastic bag.  None of them leaked; but if they had, the plastic bag should have caught the liquid.  I have now received 40 bottles from Amazon, and only one leaked."

Not nearly restaurant grade  pickled ginger,"When most reviews are so  good, I tend to be suspect of the  rare poor one. Unfortunately, after trusting the good reviews (and figuring the negative one was an outlyer of sorts), I purchased this ginger.  Extremely disappointed!  It is very thick - which to me is not a problem. But, it is unusually hot...I've never had HOT ginger before (spicy -yes,fire HOT- no).  Moreover, the balance of the spices/ingredients is just weird, leading to a very nasty bitter... almost chemical, lingering aftertaste, which I'm attributing to possibly (??) the type of or an overuse of preservative, since the nasty aftertaste isn't consistent with any of the common ingredients. If you must, try it for yourself (as did I), but be forewarned. Hopefully, I'll be able to send it back and get my return shipping reimbursed.

I'm seeing an increase in the number of grains each week, but not overwhelming.  I think my strainer allows some of the very small ones through.  It's an interesting process and I love the results.  My wife's heartburn has disappeared in the past month and I attribute it to the kefir."

I'm getting used to the flavor, introducing it to lots of friends, and enjoy making it!  It's so easy.  I love that you just throw it in a clean jar with milk and put it in the cupboard for 1-4 days.  No cooking.  The straining is easy and the whey is super sour.  I use it in smoothies and use it to ferment/pickle veggies.  Best of all, the kefir cheese is high in vitamins as well as being a fantastic probiotic.  I don't think I'll ever stop drinking/eating it.  I do a lot of traveling, but I can easily take it with me in a 3 oz. or smaller glass bottle that I keep in my hand-checked bag when I go on trips.

In 24 hours I strained the milk out of the grains and added just less than a pint (about 12 ounces) of milk to them the second time (I drank the slightly soured milk from the first batch--not bad) Within 24 hours that short pint had turned into the thickest, smoothest, yummiest kefir ever! I've made 2 more batches since and the last one was with 3 cups of milk. Absolutely perfect. I'm convinced that my next batch will do a full quart. Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />PS: I use a low heat pasteurized milk. I would not recommend using regular pasteurized milk and absolutely DO NOT use ultra-pasteurized milk. Raw milk will work but only for the first and maybe second batch as the wild bacteria in the raw milk compete with the kefir grains. If you use raw milk then always let your kefir grains renew themselves in some pasteurized milk."

I met this kind lady from Russia and found she has been drinking kefir all her life, as has her family.

It requires work and I mean DAILY maintenance to grow your grains and maintain them. I can buy a few people getting ""bad grains"" but most are probably irritated by how much work it is. You have to keep them fed and alive and you have to care. It's ok if you give up and decide it's just not for you, but don't blame the seller for your own issues. My sister in law got me interested but her milk grains were suffering because she was using Raw milk. SHE researched (not me) that using low pasturized milk helped to grow the grains so when i bought my own (from this seller) I took her advice and used low pasturized milk only as a start. HOLY COW! I uploaded a picture of my grain and it is HUGE. That is just ONE grain mind you, I have either gifted the others, used them for making cheese or (sniff, sniff) tossed them in the disposal because I don't need that much kefir. Most of my grains I have gifted have been murdered because the folks who took them didn't like the maintenance they require. It is hard work people, but it's all about what you are willing to put yourself through for good health. It's ok if you can't handle it, life is hard enough but like I said, don't blame the seller just because you couldn't hack it! Just FYI (more sis in law research here) for a casein and lactose free diet you must let the grains sit for at least 25 - 28 hours. I screwed up and only did 24 hrs and my son is supposed to be on a casein free diet so be careful... It's a science after all. My grain is now large enough that I can use raw milk but I have noticed I still have to rock back and forth between low pasturized and raw in order to keep the grain healthy. I'm sure some folks would disagree with me but I'm just going on my own experience here and the proof is in the pudding so to speak. Have fun!"

Cheairs ""GrayPrince""",1,1,5,1339286400,"I think it tastes just like Equal, but requires knowing how to use it.","This review is for the 1.7 ounce bottle.  I bought some, because I do not like the fact that over 95% of Equal is dextrose, sugar (only 1.7% is aspartame).  White sugar is a mix of dextrose and fructose.<br /><br />First off the white powder you get is sweet and tastes just like Equal to me.  For one gallon of tea I use 0.5 grams of the aspartame powder.  If you use too much you will get the bitter taste.  This is true also with Equal, if you put too many packets in it tastes bad.<br /><br />I fixed this problem long ago, I never use just Equal.  In the early days of my usage I added white sugar.  Then later I found I could drop the sugar and replace it with Sweet'N Low.  So to my tea I used 10 packets of Equal to 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.  You can drink as much as you like all day long without an after taste.  So with the aspartame powder, to my 0.5 grams of the aspartame I add the 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.<br /><br />The real problem with powdered Aspartame is it does not dissolve in water well.  It is a very fine powder and can't break the water's surface tension.  It tries to clump and even when not clumped it forms a cloudy water.  You solve this by the same method of making gravy from starch.  You put your powder in a small bowl and add water drop by drop and make a paste.  Then dissolve the paste in the water of your tea or whatever you are sweetening.<br /><br />But this is why the powdered Aspartame is packaged with dextrose in the Equal packets.  So the particles of Aspartame are separated by the dextrose particles.  Thus it dissolves."

I use to grow a lot of it myself, juice it, and drink it. In recent years I have travelled extensively and don't have the circumstances for growing and juicing barley/wheat grass. (from this point on I'll simply refer to barley grass, although all statements also apply to wheat grass).<br /><br />In recent years I have watched a multitude of cheap barley/wheat grass powders make their way onto the market. Please note that most of these products are, in my opinion, next to useless. They are made from whole dried barley/wheat grass--cellulose and all. The primary concept of having barley/wheat grass is to have the juice, free of the almost indigestible cellulose fibre of the leaf. All the early research on the many benefits of barley grass was from ingesting the pure, fresh juice. Then a process was developed (in Japan, as far as I am aware) to spray dry the juice whilst keeping most of the enzymes and nutrients intact. That processed involved using using simple sugars as a medium to help the juice turn to powder. The result is a high quality product, but one that is not pure juice powder.<br /><br />Fast forward many years, and I come across the grass juice products from Pure Planet. As you will see from my review on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DRYF4"">Just Barley - Organic Barley Juice - 80 gram - Powder</a> I give it five stars.<br /><br />Having used 5 or so jars of this product from Now Foods I have to say the product seems identical enough that I can't tell the difference. However, Now Foods gives you 118 grams for (currently) around $20 on Amazon. The Pure Planet product on Amazon is (currently) around $14 to $15. When you do the math, the Now Foods product is almost half the price.<br /><br />Obviously the many barley grass powders (not JUICE powder) as going to be a lot cheaper, but I really don't think it's worth it. Much of the nutrients in those powders are still going to be bound up in hard-to-digest cellulose, and they are far less concentrated. I've tried a few and they taste pretty poor and don't give me the lift I get from JUICE powder."

When my husband and I went to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in Pittsburgh, PA, the olive oil buyer guided us through our first olive oil purchase. She had us eat the olives that went into different kinds of olive oil and then pick the olives we liked best. Our first purchase of Zoe was the result. It is an olive oil with a distinctly buttery taste. I use it in baking cakes whenever oil or melted butter is called for. It tastes great! Absolutely great! Plus, it's heart healthy, which butter is not. Sigh. Other olives, particularly Italian olives that are made into olive oil are very peppery. Hence, their oil is peppery. This might be what other people are talking about when they say they don't like Zoe. Zoe is not a bit peppery. So please, you must try for yourself in this case. It is not a good idea to take anyone else's product review for olive oil to heart. (a pun!) You must decide what you like in an olive oil and buy according. Also, I want to mention that the buttery taste stays there even through a saute. We bought different types of Italian olive oil in smaller bottles that same first time at the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and then we came home and made fried eggs with all of them. In that venue the taste of the olive oils really came through and Zoe kept that buttery taste. Good eating!"

This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings.

Apparently, BPA links with lipid molecules very easily.<br /><br />Why can't we be sure, 8 years later, that BPA isn't leaching into food?  Unfortunately, I found that study link AFTER I'd bought these two tins, so the only thing to do is tranfer contents into glass and refrigerate.  I always keep olive oil refrigerated after opening anyway, in spite of the inconvenience when it solidifies and you have to pour warm water over the container to get it to pour.<br /><br />There's the pouring problem...  I'd read reviews beforehand, so I knew that you had to pull on the green tab to raise the plastic spout.  However, I usually don't pour much at one time, so am still getting a bit of dribble onto the top of the can.  So the plastic spout isn't working for me.  I'm considering glass containers such as the Global Amici drizzlers, just for pouring; this must be a common problem with olive oil.<br /><br />I can't detect anything buttery about Zoe Organic's taste.  And it's not as olive-like a taste as Colavita, for example.<br /><br />Next time, organic or not, I'll try something else for more flavor and to use as a dipping oil.  I'd consider the Zoe special varieties, but apparently they come in plastic containers, with no BPA disavowal in the descriptions.  With so many plastic items being imported from places with little manufacturing controls, it's not sure that any disavowal could be trusted, anyway."

Not anywhere as good a deal as it was before. This is good middle of the road, organic olive oil, been using it for last 2-3 years.

A couple of years ago the New Yorker magazine contained an article exposing all of the problems with Italian olive oils in recent years.  So I decided to switch to a Spanish olive oil, preferably organic.  Zoe ended up being my choice, mostly based on price and its fairly middle of the road flavor.  I have now been using it for about five years and remain satisfied.  It is not the best olive oil around, but it is consistently good and not priced so high as to cause pain.  I have not had problems with it going rancid.  I like the tin, but am still careful to keep it in a cool area rather than near the stove.  Once I have used half of the can's contents I prefer to decant the rest into a smaller, dark glass container.  I can't say that I love the spigot, but once I figured out how to pull it out I have had no problems.  The product stays in the tin or pours nicely into the dish or pot I am using when cooking.  I have not had any counter messes nor do I find a lot of oil around the spigot.

I tried just dipping my bread in it to see the full flavor and this is my conclusion, even thought I freely admit I am no expert or anything.  First thing I noticed was the viscosity of it, pretty thin.  I don't know if that is good or bad, just an observation.  I figure this is good for salads, and didn't have too much effect on me dipping bread, but would rather have it a bit thick.  The flavor was good, not great.  It didn't have the rich fruity, nutty flavor I was hoping for, but was OK.  I had been using Pompeian and think I prefer its flavor better, at least in dipping.  After I use this up I will go back to Pompeian, its cheap at wmart and to me has the best flavor of any I have tried.

This oil is perfect for multiple uses such as dipping, baking, and incorporating into dressings and sauces which require oil.  It is also the perfect introduction for those individuals who are new to using olive oil since the olive (fruity) taste is less pronounced than it is in other EVOO's (Extra Virgin Olive Oils).  My spouse is one of those individuals who was encouraged by the cardiologist to switch to olive oil, but who did not like its taste.  That is until, after reading the reviews on Amazon, I purchased Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  It is the first in a long line of EVOO's that has met with his approval.<br /><br />Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is light and has a buttery taste.  One can add herbs to the oil for extra flavor; it does not overpower their taste.  Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent for adding to baked goods which call for oil.  Its mild flavor does not compete with the taste of other ingredients; there is no fruity aftertaste.  Personally, I did notice a peppery bite in my throat after using this oil as a dip, without the addition of either herbs or pepper.  The aftertaste was not particularly strong and was not evident when the oil was combined with balsamic vinegar or herbs.  Amazon's price for Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent; it is far better than the cost of better EVOO's at the warehouse stores.<br /><br />This is a five-star product packaged in a three-star container.  The spout is difficult to pull out completely; pouring the oil can be a challenge.  The spout on the first can I opened was defective and split at the base when it was pulled out.  I did not notice this until I began to pour the oil and ended up with a puddle on the countertop.  Amazon's customer service was excellent with respect to resolving that issue.  I do like the size of the can which is easy to handle.  Unlike other EVOO's, Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil does not specify in which region of its country of origin the olives are grown, nor does it specify the year of harvest.  Further, unless the date is coded, the can does not indicate a best-used-by date.<br /><br />Despite these minor issues, this is a fine EVOO and I recommend it to anyone looking for a lighter, less intensely flavored EVOO.  You can't go wrong purchasing Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Amazon."

That is entirely natural, and due to a naturally occuring penolic chemical in Olive Oil called Oleocanthal.  If your olive oil doesn't zing or burn the back of your throat, then it probably is a washed out, watered down version of the real deal.  Zoe has done a superb job here with Organic Oil at reasonable price.  Choose Zoe Organic, and be happy.  I recently read an article about a vinyard in Italy that had some 500 Olive trees.  Due to weather conditions, roughly half produced annually.  Many of the trees were over 250 years old.  Olive trees live 500-900 years, and some in Syria are as old as 1,500 years.

Perhaps the fact that the oil is organic may due some justice.

It is really low in price for its organic certification and the fact that it is first cold-pressed (first cold pressing yields a much more nutritious, flavorful oil).  Other olive oils that can make those claims often cost twice what Zoe does, or more.  As to flavor, it is soft, buttery, and a little bit sweet; it tastes like olive oil (sounds dumb, but many olive oils sacrifice their fundamental ""olive-ness"" to achieve a wider appeal).  On the other hand, it is not so strong as to overpower other flavors when you cook with it.  Great for roasting garlic, as a base for sauces, and for sauteeing vegetables.  The two small tins are a nice touch, too, as you get a decent amount of oil, but can keep it half of it sealed up for freshness."

It is difficult to pour out the oil without it dripping leftovers on top.<br /><br />For those who haven't had real evoo, it might taste bitter at first- as a fresh oil will. I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread. EVOO is very healthy and should be used raw if possible, only apply light heat to it. this isn't an oil for frying."

I just accepted the fact that olive oil had a funky and unpleasant after taste.<br /><br />On a lark, I picked a few tins of the Zoe Organic when it was selling for $13.65 per two. This stuff is awesome. Great soft, mild taste that doesn't have the slimey and chemical flavor that most other olive oils have tried. I'm not an exceptional taster by any means, so I can't say it tasted like roses, or buttermilk or pepper or anything else. It's just good.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised at the small size of the tins. It isn't as big or as much oil as I pictured, but the sealed and dark tins should help it keep fresh for much longer.

The groomer recommended Duck and Potato which seemed to help a little. When we ran out of Duck and Potato, I did not want to go to the groomer to get more so I went to the locally owned pet store and picked up a bag of Chick Soup. In the time since he has been on this food we have not had a need to give him any more anti-itch pills. Also, his eyes are weeping less; by that I mean the black gooey/crusty stuff has pretty diminished greatly (we used to have to clean his eyes multiple times a day and now it's down to maybe once every few days).

Roohi,0,0,1,1342915200,I'll never feed my dog's Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul or any other food made by Diamond,"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all."

It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste.  I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice."

It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.<br /><br />When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers, people recommend using bolder, darker roasts. The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.<br /><br />In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product.

Except for too much salt, the Pacific Natural ingredient list reads pretty close to how I'd make a homemade batch if I had the time. (FWIW, the red & white canned brand is even higher sodium).<br /><br />As for the salt, one package of the PN packs 2220 mg of sodium - pretty much 100% of the RDA. I find it ironic that Pacific Natural would make this mistake, given that presumably most people buying an organic soup are probably more health conscious than those who do not. As others have noted, this soup is also more garlicky than one might expect a mushroom soup to be. I've found adding some onion powder (unsalted!) and fresh ground pepper offsets the garlic. I wish PN would do this - cut waaay back on the salt and add a bit of onion powder and black pepper to replace some of the garlic. And more mushrooms would be nice.<br /><br />Despite the cons, I prefer the healthier PN brand to the red & white canned stuff. I had given up on having condensed cream of mushroom on hand so was thrilled when I found this brand.

It's also a great movie night guilt-free snack.  I know the soy nuts can seem bland, but they've honestly grown on me.

Secondly- this stuff is dynamite! I bought Ann's for work precisely because I didn't want something that tastes ""too good"", i.e. trail mixes or candy that are full of fat, sugars, salts, and chocolate. Ann's is not sweet, but the cranberries, pumpkin seeds and occasional almond adds ample taste-appeal to the protein-packed soy. When in a captive environment like work, nibbling Ann's Energy Mix is good for you and super satisfying for the deep hunger that usually only meats, or peanut butter can fix. And, you will not even be aware of the benefit until 5 minutes after eating a handful or two. The satisfaction overcomes hunger and there is no guilt.

At first, I was hesitant to purchase, as I had bought a giant canister of soy nuts once and found that they were completely bland and left me with cottonmouth and a bad aftertaste.  I had a hard time even giving them away in the office.  So after comparing the label on the Energy Mix with several other nut & trail mixes, I found this mix to be the healthiest by far.  Per 1/4 cup serving, there are 8g fat, 3g fiber, 6g sugar(!), 0g sodium(!), and 7g protein.  As you can see, there is plenty of fiber and protein, no added salt, and the only sugar comes from the dried cranberries.  This is a big difference from other nut/trail mixes which might have a good amount of salt and/or sugar added.  That is what makes this Energy Mix a great, guilt-free snack for when you're stuck at your desk at work and feel bad about quaffing down M&M-laden trail mix to stave off your hunger.  I usually go for a run or surf after work, so I toss back a couple handfuls of the energy mix before leaving the office, and find that it gives me just the right energy fix to make it through a hard workout, and all the way to dinner.<br /><br />And the taste: well like I said, I'm not a huge fan of soy nuts, but just the right amount of dried cranberries are added to balance out the dry blandness of the soy nuts.  Throw in the almonds and pumpkin seeds and you've got a good, nutty taste to round things out.  I will say that if you are looking for bold flavor or to satisfy your sweet tooth/salt craving, then you will be let down.  But if you are looking for a good tasting, satisfying snack that you can nibble on all day without feeling guilty, then this is a perfect choice."

I would like to ask Keith S Francis where he got his so call information that the Soy Energy was not safe under FDA guidelines. If that were true it would not be allowed to be sold in the stores. It is available in COSTCO all the time. I just purchased four 36 oz containers today at costco for $7.79 per container. I also contacted the FDA and was informed that there is no truth to your posting as to the safety. Not all COSTCO's purchase the same products. It is available everyday here in California and at $7.79 per 36oz container it is very reasonably priced. The 22.00 per container price is high but the vendors on AMAZON can ask any price they want we just don't have to buy from them.

Being one of those not-so-lucky folks who have blood sugar issues, I've been told that soy is a good way of getting one's protein, and when I saw this at the big warehouse store I decided to give it a try. I like the almonds and cranberries the best (although those do have sugar so I take it easy), and yes the soy nuts are not so flavorful and might not appeal to all. I see mention in another review about the pumpkin seeds coming from China, a valid concern, but I've been snacking on these for a few weeks and haven't seen any ill effects yet :)<br /><br />In the end, it is all about choice - and there are plenty of trail mixes and nut mixes out there packed with sodium. Your call, but as long as the big warehouse store carries this I'll keep on buying and snacking.

It's a mixture of soy nuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. I'm a sucker for things like this. I can use them as a healthy snack. I can pack them in little sandwich bags and include them in my lunch package. I can bag them up for snacks in hiking walks. My wife likes them too. We snack now and then but we try to avoid salty and sweet snacks and stick to things that are nutritionally sound. These things fit the bill. They're a little bland tasting and you might wish that they were salted at least a little bit, but the protein and fiber content will make up for any taste deficits, at least in my book.

You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

I have a Keurig and never realized this was a tea and that Keurig also carried them until I was on its website. I find they are often out of stock. I found these a bit cheaper here at Amazon and stocked up. Now when I get my hair done once/month and on the morning before I infuse, this is my little indulgence. The flavors and aroma are so calming and relaxing. I even insisted that my sister-in-law who gifted us with a Keurig coffee maker two years ago, try this. I know she likes certain teas and her coffee black. She could not believe it was tea. I sent her home with a box. The only reason I don't drink it more often is due to the empty calories/sugar. I probably should take a star off for that. I am one who does not like a really strong tea or bold coffee so this really pleases my palate. The Cafe Escapes Chai Latte is hands down my favorite."

I am used to drinking Panera Bread's version, which is very good. However, chai tea is a spiced milk-based tea to me and most Americans. My Keurig adds water to its drinks so I was ready to be disappointed with this chai tea.<br /><br />As it brews and after taking a smell from the cup, you are hit with warm spices pretty hard. Cinnamon and ginger are ones that I made out but I knew right away it was going to be good.<br /><br />Taking a sip, it is obvious that this isn't a normal K-cup. Further analysis of the nutritional facts reveals that Cafe Escapes uses a creamer based formula and the result is a silky smooth chai tea latte. This is easily my favorite flavor for my Keurig coffee maker. I drink this one later in the day and it just makes you feel great. One of the best chai teas I have ever tried and WAY better than trying to brew it yourself and WAY cheaper than buying it from a cafe.<br /><br />If you don't know about Cafe Escapes and are maybe unsure of their quality, give this a shot, you will thank me (and them). They are known to use a milk-based formula in their K-cups and only make 4 flavors (Chai Tea, 2 different Hot chocolates, and a cafe mocha). I have personally tried all of their flavors and all are very good. However, the chai tea is the only one that I was absolutely blown away by. Two important notes about their brews is 1) their caffeine content is low at less than 10mg per cup (normal cup of coffee is around 100mg) and 2) they don't require you to add creamer or sugar as I am used to with other coffees.<br /><br />I felt that this review was best suited for the 96 count because if you have ever enjoyed chai tea and own a keurig coffee maker, you will be purchasing the 96-count of these at some point!"

After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button. This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers. It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great.

It's so easy to order the 34.5 ounce size via Amazon and I don't have to worry if the store has it in stock or not. Simply Smooth tastes like good ""hotel"" coffee (remember when people use to actually percolate coffee in big urns) but doesn't have a bitter or acidic effect like most other coffee. I'd change the name though because Simply Smooth sounds like a laxative versus a coffee with smooth taste.  Simply Tasty?"

Nespresso has a very tight grip on the distribution of their capsules, but a slight design change in these allows them to work with the Nespresso machines while still not infringing on their copyright.  Note: There are alternatives to this product which are re-usable called Nex-pod, and another referred to only as ""3 Brown or 3 Black""  or coffeeduck <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZEGLH2"">CoffeeDuck Refillable Coffee Capsules For Nespresso - 3 Pods - Thes Espresso Cups fit all Nespresso machines from after October 2010 - Please make sure you have the correct machine before purchasing</a>..... I haven't tried these myself, they are a bit more expensive and from what I've read in other reviews and have seen on YouTube, they didn't just didn't seem to be the best choice for me; you may want to go online and look at the Amazon reviews of these products to judge yourself.  Also, it looks like the brown ones (which are out of stock) are the ones for Nespresso machines made prior to October 2010; the black ones (still available here) are for machines after 2010 (I have the old original C190 Concept machine (model c190) from 2001). Just as an aside, I've also seen videos of people simply re-using a used Nespresso pod  and re-sealing the foil piece with a new piece of aluminum foil (I tried this once and the results were really crappy and watery, and coffee grounds ended up in my machine).<br /><br />Anyway, back to Ne-Cap.....I fill it with my own espresso grind (illy or Lavazza) and I've got to say that the coffee was good and had a decent crema.  They're pretty easy to use as well, although you might need to experiment a bit with the coffee, grind and amount you put into the capsule to ensure you get a nice rich cup of coffee.  Take out a new capsule, using your pod as the ""scoop"", scoop it to the very top and then simply wipe off the excess so it is filled to the top but not overflowing the rim, then very carefully peel off the paper ring from the top of the cup (uncovering the sticky ring on the top of the cap) and then place the pre-cut aluminum cap on top of the capsule to seal in the coffee (note: you need to be somewhat careful when you're peeling off the paper from the cup to expose the sticky seal or else you'll also remove the sticky seal which is supposed to stay on the cup).  Although the sticky seal for these capsules is not the same as the Nespresso air tight seal (which I think is only done to keep their packaged coffee fresh), the seal is good enough to perform the job and prevent coffee from exploding outside the capsules.  I know their video shows them tamping down the coffee pods as they fill them, but for me, no tamping works best (and it's simpler).<br /><br />After experimenting a bit, I noticed that if you want the richer coffee and thick crema, you should stick with a darker roasted, robusta beans, finely ground (espresso or fine grind...check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0D8"">Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian , 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a> which is primarily robusta and is on sale with subscribe and save).  And when tamping down on the coffee, don't pack it in too much before attaching the foil top or else you just get a little dribble of coffee coming out (and in all honesty, I've been using these capsules for some time, but every once in awhile, this still happens to me. The drink is fine, it just takes awhile longer to fill the cup).  Along with the illy brand of coffee,  Cafe Pico, Cafe Bustelo, Lavazza Crema and Pilon also do a very good job in these capsules. If you want to see how much coffee Nespresso uses in their capsules, you can also open up a new Nespresso capsule and see what the grind looks like and the amount of coffee they use so you get an idea. I'm too cheap to do that ;-)<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend making these cups too far in advance (since you don't have an airtight seal once you make the cup), but instead make them when you're ready to use them that day.  Although this may seem a bit of work if you're in a rush (and remember, you do have to buy your own coffee), it is sort of fun to experiment with the different blends (you can use any full or half decaff coffee for those last minute guests that want espresso without all the caffeine or you can experiment and add flavorings like vanilla, spices etc.)."

Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price.

They work great in the Nespresso Essenza C91. With this machine you have to stop the water flow, it does not stop automatically. So using these Necaps are easy, you will not get a diluted shot unless you let it run too long and this applies to Nespresso capsules as well. However your shots may come out a little short due to the Necap not holding the same amount of coffee. The Necap will also deform due to the heat from the hot water. This is normal. I like using these very much. Making them is time consuming but then so is going to the Nespresso store to buy originals or going on line. If you want to save money and have time to do this then give them a try.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Pack the coffee in tight using the bottom of an empty Necap. Don't do it so tight that it is like a rock. You also need to use espresso grind coffee. It does not have to be espresso beans, any bean will work but the coffee has to be ground on the finest setting for espresso machines.<br /><br />1. Set out several Necaps<br />2. Use a funnel to fill to top, tap side of funnel to get coffee to go down.<br />3. Use bottom of empty Necap to compact coffee. Press firmly.<br />4. Fill up to top again and compact.<br />5. Put foil on and you are done.<br /><br />You can also reload your Nespresso capsules using aluminum foil as a new cover. Cut the old foil away, rinse, clean out the used grounds, re-pack with new, place foil over and pinch tightly around rim of nespresso capsule, trim excess foil away. These can be used over about 2 times.<br /><br />Remember to run some water through the machine to heat your cup and clean out any left over grinds to get a nice tasting cup of espresso.<br /><br />My coffee makers that I have used are a T Fal drip, several different sized Bialetti Moka Express, an Aeropress, french press, my grandmas old perculator and currently the Nespresso Essenza C91. I have also made cold brewed coffee. All serve there purpose in different ways."

These seem to work as advertised, although I am still trying to figure out how much espresso to fill the pods with to get the same rich black espresso as I get from the original pods.  (Currently working on about 5 grams tamped slightly)  I will try to amend this review when I have them perfected, but I completely recommend these pods, if you want to add some lower cost espresso into your life ;-)<br /><br />Just to add to the review, the grind of the espresso is almost as important as the amount.  I played around for a while and got what other reviewers have, weak coffee, slow dribbles... but found that a slightly courser grind with a very light tamping seems to have the best results.  I have a Pixie machine and have found that due to their smaller capacity, these pods work best with a ristretto pull of espresso, meaning that a full cup will be very weak.<br /><br />*** edit ***<br />I have determined that this product isn't worthwhile, even with the increase in nespresso pods' prices.  There simply isn't a way to get enough coffee into these pods to make a decent cup.  If you cram enough coffee in to get a good espresso, the pack is too tight and the water doesn't pass through and you get strong drippings in the cup.  If you have a manual machine, like the Essenza, you can use these well, but expect two pods to make a single shot of espresso."

The Nespresso Citiz works flawlessly with Nespresso Capsules. Rich coffee with a beautiful crema. However with NeCap capsules the end result is hit and miss at best. I have tried Gevalia espresso ground espresso roast coffee in the NeCap capsules with poor results. I have tried Illy Espresso grind espresso roast with the NeCap capsules also with poor results. I have tried coffee from a local coffee house, freshly roasted and espresso grind with the NeCap capsules with poor results. I also tried India Black tea from a local India grocery with good results! Go figure.<br /><br />Preparing the NeCap capsules is a tedious process at best. Here are the steps:<br />Separate capsules from one another, this can be difficult as they tend to stick together.<br />Then separate the foil seals from one another, this can be difficult as they also tend to stick together.<br />Fill the capsules, press, then remove excess coffee with out accidentally removing the paper tape that protects the adhesive seal.<br />Sometimes the protective paper tape is not sealed carefully around the adhesive and coffee gets under the paper tape and sticks to the adhesive. Which of course needs to be removed for the foil seal to stick.<br />Assuming all goes well to this point one must then peel the protective tape and carefully align the foil seal over the capsule and seal in place.<br />These steps constitute a time consuming process which is not exactly loads of fun.<br />Lastly you must fit a small black rubber ring to the back of the NeCap capsule.<br /><br />In the box that includes all the bits needed to make a capsule is a note that reads: ""Nespresso recently modified their new machines after July/August 2010 in order to prevent the use of compatible capsules. Please use the black rings to attach to the capsule for the proper use for the latest model of Nespresso Machines."" Seems it may be time for NeCap to update their products.<br /><br />So the capsules aren't made for current machines and must be modified by the customer. Additionally the NeCap capsules are slightly smaller to avoid patent violation. These factors no doubt explain why some of the NeCap capsules won't insert properly in the Nespresso machine, or just fall through the machine to the catch tray. Lastly the coffee they make is not on par in any way, shape, or form with the capsules you purchase from Nespresso. Additionally I have noticed that the coffee made with the NeCap capsules tends to have grounds in it. Grounds don't bother me but it may others.<br /><br />Just so the readers know, I have filled a total of 43 of the NeCap capsules as of this writing. That was enough for me understand and to work through the process.<br /><br />All in all I will keep the NeCap package I bought and when I have time on my hands fill some with black tea. As for coffee, I prefer to buy from the Nespresso club.<br /><br />Summary: This is not a very well executed/designed product. The end result isn't up to the Nespresso standard.

And all that Illy I bought is not going to waste. I bought it when I was using my Delonghi EC155 - but it went belly up and since it was my second one of the same machine, I bought my Citiz w/ Milk because Ethical had just come out with their capsules (those work fine for me and I like the Cremosa) and I thought I'd give these Ne-caps a shot. (pun intended) So, after watching the videos and trying various ways of tamping, I pretty much gave the tamping up, too, much like Keith did. I have a small coffee spoon, I fill the capsule to over flowing give a light tamp with the back of the spoon, and scrape off the excess with the handle. I do five in the morning (or the night before) for the 3-5 espressos I'll drink throughout the day. From pulling the coffee out to sealing the capsules and putting the coffee away takes less than 2 minutes - and the espresso using my Illy is just great!

How someone can say that they don't work in their machines is beyond me, I don't think they tried them or they didn't use the ring or they over tamped the capsules.<br /><br />As to cost, yes, each capsule is 20 cents empty, but the Nespresso capsules just jumped up a little over 5% to 60 cents a capsule plus shipping. My espresso needs would be cost prohibitive if I used Nespresso exclusively. I do plan on buying some of the lungo capsules in decaf for my few friends who don't do caffeine, but since I've never had any other than the sample capsules of Nespresso I'm not missing anything and really, it's Illy in my ne-caps...Illy (and the Lavazza when I run out of that) (I may have a problem)"

The capsules are about 60% the size of the standard Nespresso capsules, so unless you like your coffee very weak, these Ne-Caps are not for you.  Even using as a single shot, the coffee tastes watered down.<br />2.  The version of of foil seals in my box are self-adhesive; much less fooling around than the peel-off rings contained in other kits.  Still this foil is much thinner than that found on standard Nespresso capsules, and may contribute to the excessive grinds that show up in the brewed product.<br />3.  I want fiber in my diet, but not fiber in my coffee; there are ALWAYS residual coffee grinds in the cup.  The brewed coffee often looks murky; there is always a ring of tiny coffee grinds.<br />4.  There are no instructions in the box, but the tiny rings SEEM to belong on the underside of the capsule, as without them the capsules tend to fall right through the slot on the Nespresso machine.  Why bother with the rings?  Why not make the the capsule tops a bit thicker in the first place?<br /><br />So until they make a bigger capsule, and solve the ""dirty coffee"" problem, this is a Two Star product."

Troitzsch,1,1,1,1338249600,"Does not work well, more plastic waste","I tried these on my Pixie machine, and since the capsules are not really made for it but older machines, they don't work well for newer models. The retrofit ring the capsules come with are a cheap band aid. I tried around 20 capsules before giving up. Most of the time there was excessive water flowing into the reservoir due to said incompatibility with the newer machines like my Pixie. I cannot speak for the older models.<br />There is also an environmental issue:<br />Once used, the ne caps are done and go into the garbage -  cutting the lid and using the grind for mulch is a good idea. However reusing them seems pointless and it is harder to separate the plastic from the aluminum left over lid than with the Nespresso type which is all aluminum.<br /><br />The better and much cheaper option: REUSE THE ORIGINAL NESPRESSO CAPSULES<br />I cut open and empty the regular Nespresso capsules to use the grind for mulch, then after washing and drying refill them at least once for another round with my favorite Espresso, crema type. The lid is a simple aluminum foil cut from standard foil roll (you can make multiple lids at the same time by layering foil pieces then cutting the circular lids with a scissor all at once. Make sure the circle is not too big, it should not extend too far up the capsule cone but stay neatly wrapped around the lip. Otherwise it can be leaky). Here a good link<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This means every so often you have to buy new capsules, but refilling them probably cuts the cost per capsule by 50% min. if used 2-3 times."

The truth is that after a while you get tired and upset of wasting so many caps and coffee. In other words it doesn't work, they shouldn't be selling this scam!"

It took a bit of time and care but I didn't mind.<br /><br />However, we have a Nespresso Clitiz and the Ne-Caps, even with the fitting rubber band required for this unit are a bit problematic.

I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules, it was excited.  Unfortunately, they don't work.  They are too thin that they crush when you put the lever down. Good idea but it would be great if they work.  Maybe, next time."

Obviously this takes a little bit of time, you'll need to grind your own bean, fill the pods, undo the adhesive and stick on the foil.  It's really quite easy, it doesn't take any real coordination, and it is even a little bit fun. I would think most people would not care to put in the effort to use this product, but if you get a kick out of getting a better price for something and like working with your hands, this is a nice alternative.  You wont get rich off your savings, and there is a considerable amount of time and effort to make use of these, but it's not nearly as hard as some reviewers say, and the success ratio of each pod is very good.  Once you get the hang of it, you can make pods pretty quickly. Try it if you think it's for you, it does work and tastes great!"

These capsule are not perfect, but provide a good alternative.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- you can grind the coffee you like (I have used, so far, Illy beans and beans from the KC Roasterie)<br />- coffe has a density and creaminess typical of Italian baristas, you can actually taste the layers of the beans and the (small) crema blends well with the coffee<br />- you can save some money, or get better quality beans for the same price as Nespresso<br /><br />CONS:<br />- it takes a while to practice with these capsules (at least 20)<br />- coffe has still some variability (occasionally it comes out watery, but when it is well done it is way better than Nespresso)<br />- it's a bit messy (so not good for your office machine)<br />- foil does not always seal perfectly<br /><br />With time, I realized that the following steps improve a lot the quality of the espresso you get:<br />1. poor small amounts in your capsule and press heavily each time (secret for a good and rich espresso is how the water goes through the coffee)<br />2. seal tight eliminating as much air as possible<br />3. MAKE A RISTRETTO. If you drink long Nespressos, this is not for you, as the coffee will not be strong enough. The amount of coffee in the cup should be about 1/3 of a small cup with illy logo (yes, very little, that's why it is called espresso).<br /><br />I will buy these products again and try with other beans.  Personally, I often get tired of the fake crema of Nespresso and the limited availability of strong and intense ristretto varieties."

The real thing does not sit well on air-popped popcorn. I tried sprays (one was pretty good); but, I think this one tastes the best in my humble opinion. I have a heavy hand when it comes to buttering my popcorn. Hot-air-popped popcorn is quite dry and needs some kind of liquid topping to make salt or flavored seasonings stick to it. This is about as close to theater popcorn as you can get. I use the Kernel's Ranch and other flavorings (also from Amazon) and popcorn salt. I am not a once-in-a-while-I-think-I'll-have-some-popcorn-type person...it is more like 5 to 7 times a week for more years than I like to count. I have put it on the automatic delivery schedule of Amazon so I am never without it.  It is great to use on baked potatoes and vegetables to boot. It does have a tendency to get too thick to shake onto the popcorn; but, I just run the hot water on it while the corn is popping and it is great. I think it is because I keep the air conditioning on to around 63 deg. I think it tastes better than butter and hope they never discontinue making it. God bless"

I asked several local theaters what they really use (and not what this product's makers claim) and they told me they melt Promise margarine for their corn.  Much tastier and a lot less money.

But when I'm on the run, or don't want to deal with tea leaves (all my teas are loose, because honestly, it's just better that way), something instant is always a good idea. Since Chai Tea began my love for tea, I began searching for the perfect instant chai. When I found this, I was extremely skeptical. How can this tiny little thing make 100 cups of tea? And the price? Why should I pay that much money for something that might not taste good?<br /><br />Luckily for me, I had just gotten paid the day before. So I bought this on a whim and crossed my fingers.<br /><br />When this arrived, I was so excited that I couldn't help but make a cup right then and there. The tin is very, very small, which deterred me somewhat, but I pressed on. A tiny wooden spoon rests inside the chai (and if you can't find it, try digging it up a little with a toothpick). I took a spoonful of the mix and put it into a 12 oz cup, and added another scoop for good measure. I added a little hot water and some milk and took my first sip. The spices hit me like a train. After swallowing, it leaves a trickle of spice in the back of your throat--something very few chais have managed to do. This chai is very spicy, but not cinnamon spicy like some other chais. The taste is truly organic.<br /><br />If you don't like chai that's loaded with spice, then this tea isn't the one for you. But if you don't like spicy teas, you shouldn't be seeking out traditional chais. This tea most likely won't last me through 100 cups (as I like my tea strong), so I guess 50 will have to do. For $0.34 a cup ($0.16 if you only use one scoopful), you can't really go wrong. I would highly suggest trying this one out."

He drinks about 4 cups a day and before the keuring use to have an espresso maker and make a cup at night. I don't think I've seen a day where he DOESN'T drink coffee lol<br /><br />So when I heard about the Starbucks K-Cups coming out back in late October early November, I knew this was something I wanted to try. But instead of buying a box for myself, when I saw the flavors I knew I rather buy one for my father instead. Well I was skeptical about it after I brought it home, but low and behold he drank every single cup in a week! Beside this brand and the ""Rev"" bold coffee, I think this is a winner! My father HATES flavored coffee and so it was all about the good taste of something bold.<br /><br />So if you know someone who drinks only blod coffee and maybe also loves Starbucks, but also has a Keuring, get them this coffee! This could actually be cheaper than going to Starbucks. Also Bed, Bath & Beyond sells the cups. If you've got a 20% off coupon, especially around the holidays and can't afford it on Amazon, try there to maybe test run this flavor."

Overall, they did a very good job. But one big caveat: If you get a Tall or Grande at Starbucks, one K-cup is not going to a good substitute. The largest setting on a Keurig platinum is 12oz, which is a Tall in Starbucks lingo. I've enjoyed this at 8oz, but too much of a sacrifice at larger settings. What this means is I typically need 2 K-cups for my morning fix. This can be an issue for any of the bold coffees, but since I've been a Starbucks Sumatra drinker for years, I notice it more---in taste and in my wallet. I'll continue to buy this, but I'm also drinking Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M9ZLEG"">Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>It's cheaper and I can use the 10 oz setting."

Here's Why!,"In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the ""K-Cup"" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.<br />When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Sumatra Dark - Pike Place + Colombian + French Roast + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian & Sumatra Dark Roast are the Best of the lot and the French Roast is also recommended to try out.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!"

82788,82789,B00122CM60,A2QTDL1XR2HTX,Escape,2,2,5,1339286400,Great Soup!! Very Versatile.,"Many people, including myself grew up on this soup. It was one of the few vegetables I looked forward to as a kid. This is my favorite vegetable soup, and I pretty much judge all others against it. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find this product in my area. In fact, I can't find it at all. It was refreshing to stumble across it here on Amazon. I had not previously purchased more than one bag at a time when I wanted it. But after ordering it in bulk, I found a few other uses for it.<br /><br />Normal Use- This soup is great just by itself. Add water and you are good to go. But it is best if you add your own touch to it. I suppose each family has their own way of using it. I like to add stew meat (as per the instructions), and also a little extra carrot, celery, potatoes that I have on hand. You could pretty much add any vegetable, or even some canned tomato product to make it just how you like it. It's an awesome launch pad for perfect vegetable beef soup.<br /><br />Camping- It is a great camping food to take along. Take along some frozen stew meat, a carrot, a potato, etc. Brown the meat in a dutch oven over some coals, throw in the sliced vegetables and let it simmer for an hour. Your friends will be amazed wondering how you made such a great soup without a bunch of vegetables, and spices. It's super easy and fills you up with some tasty warm nutritious food on chilly nights.<br /><br />Prepping/Food Storage- This is a shelf stable food that lasts a very long time just sitting in the pantry. It is also easy to use by just adding water. Perfect for emergencies, or times when you may be unable to get to the store. If you can simmer water, you can have a satisfying meal for the whole family with this stuff.<br /><br />Potlucks- I hate those times when at the last minute I remember I have a potluck to do at work the following day. No problem. Get the large crockpot out of the cupboard. Cook it however you like it that night, then store in the fridge. Throw it in the crock pot the next day an hour or so before the time. Just add some paper bowls, bag of oyster shaped crackers, and plastic spoons and you'll be bringing home an empty crockpot.<br /><br />This really is a very versatile great tasting soup. Perfect item to have on hand!!!"

When Walmart stopped carrying it for sale I looked on the 'net to see where I could get it. Amazon has been great to deal with on getting it in bulk packages of 8.<br /><br />My way of making it involves adding 12 cups water, fresh garlic, onions, sliced carrots, celery and beef from either leftover roast/steak or inexpensive beef steak browned (leftover chicken in the chicken soup mix). I also add one can of diced tomatoes with a couple of beef bouillon cubes. In order to have the best taste it needs to simmer on the stove for at least 3 hours.<br /><br />This will make enough to feed a lot of people or by freezing the remains, Dinner for 1 for many nights (3 for me, I am a big eater).

And believe me I haves tried all of them available in the stores.  The only reason I refer to it as second best if because I also buy the Bear Creek veggie beef soup mix also available on Amazon, (link enclosed).  I have to give the nod here to Bear Creek for just being a little spicier, and in my opinion having just a tad better beef broth.

This coffee is not as strong to me as this company's Fog Chaser brand, and is good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />Several folks in my office have also ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.

To our surprise, we like its bold flavor better than the other brands. I always thought higher prices meant better tasting coffee. Not true! When we bought a Keurig coffee machine last January, I was resigned to trading a taste I prefer and an outstanding value, for the single cup convenience of the K-cups, which meant buying the more expensive brands of coffee in K-cups. Fortunately, the SFB Coffee people have made a single serving cup which fits in Keurig machines. It has the same flat, round top as K-cups, but the cup portion is a mesh filter cup, not made of plastic as with a K-cup. The SFBC cups work just as well in your Keurig machine and with less waste. I take a 16-oz. travel mug to work each morning, and I find the flavor to be consistent whether I make 8 ounces or 16 ounces. My sister-in-law's husband calls himself a coffee snob. He tried the SFBC French Roast for the first time today and was blown away by its rich flavor. He's now a believer and has ordered his first case."

I read reviews after the purchase, because I liked it so much, I came to Amazon because I wanted to see if I could order it online and save us a trip, and I got a real chuckle out of some of the reviews. I'm not sure of why the product got such bad reviews from some people. Yes, it is a strong coffee,and maybe too strong for some people, even our son said it was ""stout"", but we first brewed it on the smaller settings. Now we brew on the largest setting, and have had no problems with it. Also, because of the design, we put the cups in an airtight container to help keep them fresh, so don't store them outside in one of the many K-cup holders that are popular. In the end, I guess it really is true that if you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one, and I'm sure there are those in the internet world who could make a career out of complaining, but I would recommend the product to anyone, with the caviat that it is a bit on the strong side, and to be aware that taste is truly subjective, but I think overall, It's a good product and the price is great."

But don't think these are just cheap coffees, I'd put these two San Francisco Bay coffees in my list of favorites for sure. There may be better coffees available depending on your taste, but you're going to pay more for them, guaranteed.<br /><br />The SF Bay cups are a bit different than your typical k-cup and actually I would consider them a bit more environment friendly. While the top of the k-cup remains similar to other K-cups, with a puncture foil top and plastic ring, there is no plastic shell or 'cup' around the base and filter. Instead, the filter is exposed. For this reason, the coffee is exposed to air when you first open the bag.  Fortunately, the 36 cups come wrapped in 3 separate 12-packs. Once we open a pack, we transfer the cups to a ziploc to keep them fresh...no biggee, and still worth the savings.<br /><br />Buying this versus another brand on Amazon or at Sam's club saves us about $20 a month since we drink about 4 cups a day.

Newhouse,0,0,4,1341100800,"Good almost-K-cup concept, don't like this flavor","**See update below**<br />First, I want to say that in general I very much like the San Francisco Bay ""One Cup"" coffee products - their Fog Chaser and Rain Forest blends are two of my favorite K-cups.  As has been mentioned in many other reviews, they don't look like ""normal"" K-cups, but they work in Keurig brewers.  Never had any problems with the brand or the innovative cup design.<br />I also like Amazon's Frustration Free packaging option - between that and the reduced plastic in the cup itself, this is a good less-waste alternative, and the price is great.<br /><br />However - I really don't care for this particular French Roast variety.  I'm not especially picky about coffee - I like a variety of brands, roast styles, and flavors.  Specifically, I tend to prefer ""Dark"" and ""Extra-bold"" K-cups.  But this particular French Roast just doesn't work for me.  Some of the cups have been worse than others, but I find the coffee to be especially bitter, with a very distasteful burned flavor.  With most coffee, I can enjoy it black, but I usually add just a little bit of cream and sugar.  For this variety, I have to add an extra slug of cream, which balance out the bitterness just enough to be ""OK"".  With this amendment, they're not quite bad enough to throw away, but I definitely won't be purchasing more.<br /><br />To summarize: SF Bay K-cups are great - if you stick to the non-French Roast varieties.<br /><br />**Update: After receiving the prompt comment on this review from SFBay's customer service, I gave them a call.  I immediately talked to a real person at the company (not some random call center), who was very helpful and communicated clearly.  This helpful rep was primarily focused on making me happy with their coffee, and to that end, he sent me three replacement bags of different varieties (which I knew I liked) at no cost.  I've tried those and, as usual, they're excellent.  He was also concerned that there might be something wrong with the batch or roast that I had received, and provided me with a pre-paid label to return the old coffee so they could test it.<br />So I'm still not sure whether I got a bad batch, or whether I just don't like this flavor.  Hence my 4/5 stars.  But either way, with customer service of this caliber, it's DEFINITELY worth trying the coffee!  Highly recommended.  My review was therefore changed from 2 stars to 4."

But I understand that I may have a unique situation not having to pay taxes on Amazon purchases but on local purchases I do.  Some may have no sales tax or may have to pay tax on Amazon purchases.  With the S&S this is way better than the other option (IMO). With that being said, it is an excellent bold coffee at a good price.  There is a little bit of residue at the bottom of the coffee cup when I am done but nothing major.  With some of the ""make your own cups"", I ended up with a gritty and terrible last drink which deterred me from wanting to use those things.  I even bought a burr grinder in the hope that with a coarser grind I wouldn't get that but it still had a terrible last swig.

They are foil sealed with a plastic ring around the top, and the rest of it is a filter. When placed in the brewer, just a hole gets punched on the top, not bottom. Something new perhaps? I tried a cup and I admit, it was very good coffee, full flavor. I will purchase these again and do recommend them. These do arrive in a shipping box, but the k-cups are sealed in plastic bags."

I saw the San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCups on Amazon and was intrigued by the price and the unusual design. I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee. The only downside I have experienced so far is that the pods do need to be stored in a zip-lock baggie since they are not airtight."

Hines,54,63,3,1325376000,"Not bad, but decidedly unlike any other K-Cup product","Full disclosure - I worked briefly for the people who make this product back in the late '70s.  Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it.  And it's not bad - it's OK, but it's just a bit odd.<br /><br />First off, the packaging.  These aren't your father's K-Cup, where it's an actual cup.  These have a top like the traditional cup (so they'll fit in the brewer) but the bottom is completely different.  It's almost more like a filter than a cup, and kinda rounded rather than cup-shaped.  They come in sealed plastic bags of twelve, so you need to keep them in a ziplock bag or some kind of airtight container once you open the bag, unless you're planning on using them all right away.<br /><br />Second, the flavor.  It's OK, not bad at all, but it just tastes a little off for some reason.  A hint of odd flavor.  Also, it seems to lack body, for want of a better term.  It doesn't have that rich, full, satisfying flavor I expect from a good cup of French Roast.<br /><br />Lastly, it seems to leave more sediment in the bottom of the cup than traditional K-Cups - not sure if that's a by-product of the design or what.<br /><br />Bottom line - it's not like I'm going to throw them away.  I'll keep them and drink them, but I probably won't buy them again.  I much prefer the flavor of just about any regular K-Cup to these, even non-premium brands like Folger's.<br /><br />UPDATE: After drinking my way through the whole case and comparing them with other K-Cup products, I have a bit more appreciation for these and might consider buying them again, particularly given the excellent price of around 38 cents a cup if you use Subscribe and Save.  One other point I neglected to mention in my original review is that these seem to produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam that appears on top of a good cup of coffee - than most K-Cup products.  Keep an eye out for my reviews of the Rainforest Blend (which I found somewhat weak and flavorless) and Fog Chaser (which just arrived and I've yet to sample) varieties coming soon."

I should get that out of the way first, because I know not everyone appreciates deep, dark coffees. Aside from Dark Magic and Mahogany, this is better than almost every k-cup I have tasted.<br /><br />I may be in the minority here, but I actually prefer the filter-like bottom of these pods over the k-cup for four reasons:<br /><br />1. I've noticed no difference in freshness compared to the Nitrogen-filled, sealed k-cup.<br /><br />2. I don't have to waste filtered water and keep a paper clip handy to unclog the coffee grounds that get stuck in the needle of the Keurig because of pressure and temperature differences between where the k-cup was sealed and where it gets punctured.<br /><br />3. When brewing with these One Cups, the kitchen smells of freshly brewed coffee, an aroma I had missed when using k-cups.<br /><br />4. (And I realize not everyone will feel this way) - warning, nothing but complaining ahead:<br /><br />I had begun resenting being beholden to Keurig. I dutifully sent them money each month for k-cups and each month they found new ways to make me regret it. (Not shipping the k-cups out at all, allowing my package to sit in their warehouse for a week while they assured me it was on its way, consistently being out of stock of the k-cups I wanted and most of all, whenever I called or wrote to point out a problem, issuing a coupon code for free k-cups but then repeating the problem the following month.

That is, while there are many types of coffees available, only Green Mountain can make the K-cup because of their patent.  Pricing has been held fairly high and steady. It would be nice to have a choice and better pricing.<br /><br />The SF Bay coffee appears to be a good alternative. I have used it for 2 weeks and it seems to be compatible with the Keurig machine. The coffee taste is good. I prefer a stronger taste and am ok with it a bit more bitter. As a frame of reference, I find the average 7 oz cup too weak and use the 3 or 5oz setting.<br /><br />As others have noted, the coffee comes in small bags of 8 ""pods"" each. You have to put the open bag in a ziploc bag for storage because the coffee in the pods is exposed in the filter.<br /><br />I really like the price of the SF Bay coffee. It is good value and feel like I have a choice.<br /><br />I am not a SF Bay employee or shareholder. I just want reasonable pricing and choice."

I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer.

Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!"

They are sold in boxes of 12 (Amazon sells you 3 of those boxes at a time), so as long as you just open one at a time and you finish the box within two weeks, it is not a concern - at least I have had no problem with staleness!<br />They are also less expensive with the Subscribe and Save - a win-win all around!"

Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!"

It looked more like just a plain coffee filter in a shape of a K-cup, sort of a look through contraption.

It's very good and the cost is a fraction of what other K-cups are going for these days. I paid less than .50 per cup. I have a Keurig Platinum Edition brewer (from America's favorite home shopping channel:) and the cups work fine in my machine. I prefer a medium roast flavor so I brew the 8 oz cup and it does not taste watered down. If you prefer a light tasting coffee you could even brew the next size up; someone who enjoys a darker flavor may want to use the smaller cup setting. The cups do fit in my Keurig carousel display holder. However, the coffee is essentially contained in a thick paper filter so if you won't be using the pods quickly then you might want to get yourself an airtight container to store the unused pods/cups to maintain freshness. They arrive in a vacuum-sealed package that is not resealable. If you're on the fence about whether or not to try this brand, go for it - you'll be glad you did."

My only suggestion for San Francisco Bay Coffee would be to use a zip-lock bag to help preserve the freshness of unused K-cups. Give this a try--its great coffee!"

I was sceptical but decided to try the SF Bay French Roast, Fog Chaser and Rainforest blends. I generally like strong, dark blends like emerils or dark magic. Overall, all 3 of the SF Bay blends are really good. The French Roast is my favorite though. It is strong and has a rich flavor and is not bitter. The fog chaser is STRONG and a bit bitter. The Rainforest is a bit less strong and has a slight bitterness. All are good strong blends but I like the richness of the French Roast.

I am very pleasantly surprised at the wonderfully flavorful coffee that they made!  I am very particular about my coffee and like only very dark flavorful roasts.  I had not really been pleased with any of the K-cups--some of course were better than others--and had pretty much settled on Starbucks Verona as my favorite, but these are better!  (And--MUCH less expensive!)<br />My Keurig Platinum is at my beach home (only weekend usage and not every weekend at that!) so I was a bit concerned about this style K-cup staying fresh once the individual bag was opened.  A bag ended up staying very fresh for several weeks--of course I resealed the bag with a couple of clips as well as I could--so this is no longer a concern of mine.  I will be a regular consumer!"

I had been eyeballing these San Francisco Bay brand here on Amazon for awhile, but hadn't purchased them.  When I saw them at Costco (by the way, they sell them in a box of 80 for about $25), I decided to take the plunge.  And they're not bad.<br /><br />As mentioned by others, the 'cup' design is essentially a paper filter filled with coffee grounds and then attached to the underside of a plastic ring which fits into the Keurig brewer.  The top is sealed off with the traditional thick foil which is pierced by the top needle of the Keurig brewer.  The bottom needle which pierces the bottom of the standard K Cups does not even come into play with these as the water is forced into the grounds.  The coffee passes through from the filter and then directly out the bottom of the  k cup holder and into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Like every traditional K-Cup these are a bit on the weak side, especially as you increase the cup size on your brewer, but I usually brew at the 8 oz setting and I thought these were acceptable.  It does have the (for lack of a better word) 'burnt' French Roast flavor which is surprisinly absent from most so-called 'dark roast' K-Cups and that is much appreciated.<br /><br />My only issues with these cups are the freshness issues.  Since the coffee is basicaly hanging out in the open air (only the paper filter separates it from the outside world) they will change taste very quickly.  I saw someone mention that the Amazon package has them in individual bags of 12.  The bos from Costco has them in individual bags of 8, so of course the manufacturer is aware of the issue of them going bad more quickly.  I personally would prefer they be bagged with quantities no more than 4 or 5 - the quantity I would use up in 2 or 3 days.  I don't have one, I think they look tacky, but if you have one of those 'Carousels' on your counter to display your k cups, I think this product would be completely incompatible with it.  My other issue is that since this coffee drips directly from the filter into the k cup holder on the machine, the holder will have to be washed regularly (probably daily) lest the coffee oils build up and change the final coffee taste even more..<br /><br />I'm generally happy with this product though, and probably will buy it again. with proper storage in an airtight container, I think the economical price evens out the freshness issues."

I have tried the Starbucks pods, and they are ok, but not as good as some of the other coffees that I have had.<br /><br />This is a strong roast.  It came in 3 bags with 12 ""pods"" in each bag.  They do not use the plasic cups on the outside, but just use a little coffee filter attached to a plastic disc which still fits in the keurig pod hole.  The needle in the Keurig Machine is not touched by the SF Bay pods.  This eliminates those stray grounds from finding your cup of coffee, or potentially clogging up the your brewer.  The filter bag with the coffee in it is not firm before it is used, but the grounds swell during the brewing process and the bag has a much firmer, fuller look after it is brewed.<br /><br />The coffee itself is pretty decent.  I think for the price, I would much rather pay 13 for a pack of 36, than 13-18 for a pack of 24 any day.  After the bag is opened, I put the unused coffee pods into a zip lock bag and have not had an issue with freshness.  I actually tried a green mountain donut house from a previous order, and when compared with the SF Bay, I prefered the San Fran Bay French Roast.<br /><br />EDIT: 29 Mar 2012<br />I usually leave the pod in the brewer until I brew again.  Recently noticed that the SF Bay pods have been dripping a little coffee after being brewed.  Not enough to make a significant mess, but it has been getting on the bottom of my mug and I notice a ring on my desk occassionally if I have 2 cups in the morning.

The coffee is good, aromatic, and strong. So strong that I can usually squeeze two cups from a single K-cup. It's also environmentally friendly due to the packaging containing a filter at the bottom instead of plastic. This is a double edged sword though because it tends to result the coffee losing flavor after extended periods (2-3 weeks if left out and open).<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for coffee that costs $.30 cent per cup, this is a good choice - just be sure to put open bags of it in a zip-lock for freshness."

Anderson,4,5,4,1334966400,"Great flavor, but not as strong as other brands.","I just recently tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee one cup for the Keurig and instant brewers. I was a little leery of trying them as many people have been but decided to give them a try. They were a little less expensive and I figured if I liked them it would be worth it. I love the flavor. I don't mind the way its packaged at all. And they work great in my Keurig machine. The only difference I find is because of it being a filter holding the coffee rather than the plastic cup with a tiny hole - after the coffee is brewed it drips a while longer because of the open filter. Not a big deal - just something to mention. The other thing about the SFBay French roast that I bought - compared to the other French Roast varieties - when I use my largest cup setting on my Keurig machine (mine has 3 sizes to choose from) it is not nearly as strong. If I use the small setting, which is about half the amount - it is the same strength as other French roast K-cups. So for me - wanting to save a little money by trying the San Francisco Bay cups - it really isn't working out that way as I use 2 K-cups on the small cup setting to fill my big coffee mug. So price wise - it comes out about the same as what I have been paying for the others. But it is excellent - strong and good flavor. I kind of like that they come packaged in individual plastic bags of 12. And it is no big deal to put them in a little jar or container by my machine. I do that with my regular coffee maker - so this is no different. Not sure why others feel that is a problem. Hope this helps anyone who is considering buying this brand. I would definitely recommend it - and would give it 5 stars on taste - but just did 4 because of it not making a large mug as strong as I like."

Since then I've compared it to ""Green Mountain Nantucket Blend"", alternating between the two with an occasional ""Tully's Italian Roast"" mixed in.<br /><br />My wife prefers the slightly bolder blend of the Tully's; I prefer the Green Mountain. Both of us have found the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"" to be a good blend that's robust while not overwhelmingly bitter. It may well become our coffee of choice.<br /><br />Personally, I find the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"" to have a bit of a biting after taste that I don't experience with the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"".<br /><br />I have friends who only use K-cups. I've given them samples of the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". Their taste runs more to the bolder coffees. Both of them love the coffee.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented about the sediment left in the bottom of the cup from the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". I agree with them, there is sediment; it's just like I experience with the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"". That seems to be typical of some of the bolder blends and especially the darker roasts. It may also be that the beans are ground finer on these blends to extract more flavor in the brew cycle.<br /><br />These are not traditional K-Cups but they'll work just as well in your Keurig coffee maker. I actually think I get better water flow through the coffee with this new design. My only complaint is the need to keep them sealed rather than in the carousel where I normally store my K-Cups. The cups are packaged in a very heavy plastic bag, which is properly vented for storing coffee. I cut the top enough to remove one cup at a time, then fold over the top and put a clip on it. We drink enough coffee that the 8-cup bag only lasts a couple of days. It's really not a big deal.<br /><br />Should you try it? Probably.<br /><br />I enjoy good coffee, even more when it's reasonably priced. I'm not a ""coffee snob"" and I'm willing to try new things.

Here's my take on the French Roast after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer this to the Fog Chaser, but I like a darker roast.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is bold, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like really dark roasts but most people don't.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine."

But that doesn't matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture.<br /><br />Off course, being green doesn't matter if the coffee tastes bad.  In this case, it does not.  It's got to be one of the two best French Roast K-Cups I have ever had.  Full of flavor, without being bitter or burnt.

I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer.

It would have been nice if the plastic bag they came in was re-sealable.<br />Also, since the coffee doesn't just come out of a small hole in the bottom of the pod, the first cup you make with these will wash all the stray grounds out of your machine and into your cup.

This brand does not need refrigeration, as it has gone through some sort of processing (pasteurization perhaps, yeast removal, I don't know really) to negate the need for storage and shipping complications.  Of course, the downside is that health benefits attributed to natural kombucha are somewhat lost here, since processing kinda tends to that, but it still contains bacteria cultures (at least according to the label), it's still ""organic"" and most importantly, it still retains that vinegary kick that sort of defines the kombucha taste.  Make no mistake, this product is far sweeter than GT Dave's, 60 calories for an 8.4 ounce can (vs. 60 calories for a 16 oz bottle of GT's ), but it's still got some kombucha-y flavor.  It's perhaps not as ""yeasty"", and is certainly missing any hint of alcohol from the original fermentation - I'd need a bottle of GT's to compare to be sure - but it goes down nice and easy anyway.  It would be a good way to get into drinking kombucha for someone that isn't used to it yet.<br /><br />So, it's not a replacement for GT's or any other naturally fermented and bottled kombucha product (several come to mind that have pulled from shelves), but it *is* tasty, organic, shelf stable, and convenient, and I like it for that reason.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I've tried two (of many) from this brand now, the ""traditional"" and the ""green tea and lemon"".  So far my preference leans to the ""green tea and lemon"" just because I like the tartness of the lemon.  The ""traditional"" hints at stereotypical sweet tea, with that kombucha-y vinegar kick, but it's just a little sweet for me.

The drink isn't 'fake healthy' like a lot of other 'healthy' beverage companies. It is the perfect mixture of health in a can and it's low calorie (low cal's are important to me, since I don't like to drink my calories). I love how Amara is like ""water +"". I am someone who tries to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and water can get boring, but I have found Amara to be my go-to as my water with a kick. I like that it is low in sugar, has a light zing of carbonation, and that I can drink multiple 16oz cans (can't do that with any liquid besides water) and it's never overwhelming nor boring. It truly is my water alternative and it is sure addicting.<br /><br />I will admit I was nervous to try Amara for a few reasons, one because it looked like an energy drink (I really dislike those). Two, because I am sensitive to caffeine, but I've never felt glittery or weird from the amount of caffeine in Amara (maybe because of the electrolytes it has and so I never feel dehydrated or off from it), and three because I am a runner and thought the carbonation would hurt my stomach, but surprisingly it never did and made me feel great during and after a workout!

Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a ""good"" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought ""stuff"", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes!

I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)"

Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as ""inspected for human consumption"". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above."

Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.

Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to ""earn"" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the ""girls"" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my ""grand-dog"" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a ""luxury"" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their ""treatie-time.""<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!"

I am glad that I read other reviews first.  The top of these cups are not as big around (diameter) as a regular k-cup.  In fact I was afraid that it wouldn't fit.  But they do.  Then they lack all the plastic that surrounds a normal k-cup on the bottom.  So they definitely look different and weird.  But taste is what is important.  Well taste and price.<br /><br />Taste- I have only tasted Fog Chaser.  It definitely has an upfront bitterness (or acidity) to it.  It is the first thing I notice.  Don't get me wrong.  I actually enjoy some acidity to my cup of coffee.  Otherwise I find it to be a bit bland.  After the acidity comes a great taste.  Very rich and strong.  In fact I think this is the strongest, boldest k-cup I have had.  Only real concern here is the packaging allows the coffee to go stale faster than if each was sealed individually.  It is nice that they come in three separate sealed bags.  But I think we will go through them fast enough that it would not be a problem.  If you drink very slowly and allow these to linger for several weeks I think the taste will definitely be an issue.<br /><br />Price- At 49 cents per cup this is unbeatable.  Then you have the option of buying on subscription and get them at 41 cents per.<br /><br />Conclusion= I love rich/strong coffee and I love the price.  sold."

Rich, flavorful, bold, and very tasty.<br /><br />I was put off by the odd look of the cup at first...as many others have described, it looks strange when you first see it.  If you turn it upside down it looks like a cranium in a hair net.  But it's just as easy to use as a typical k-cup, so no problem there.  The only problem you might have is trying to place it in one of those vertical k-cup dispensers you can get wherever you buy k-cups.  This cup doesn't sit well in there.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice when you open the cardboard box and cut open the rather thick plastic pouch the 12 containers come in: the smell.  It's extremely rich, a very deep, bold smell that makes you think of your very best cup of coffee ever.  Think about it, though: that's the smell of your coffee when it's manufactured and placed within the container.  I doubt the plastic k-cups are as bold when they're tapped into by the Keurig machine...I'm sure they've disseminated some of the freshness on their way to you.<br /><br />What I do to keep that flavor is to take each cup out of the nice thick bag and immediately re-seal the bag with a strong clip.  I feel that retains the flavor.  In that sense, I'm glad they don't fit on the vertical k-cup dispensers...I like that the freshness stays intact within the thick plastic bag.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this flavor.  Keep it secure in the plastic pouch and you'll have a great fresh taste every time you want a cup."

I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic.

You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices.

It comes in bulk (12 per bag) and the One Cups have the same top as the K-cup but insead of the plastic housing it is a filter material.  This might bother some people.  I store them in a plastic zip lock so they will stay fresh.  The filtering process through a filter rather than the plastic housing might be what makes it taste so good or it may just be the coffee.  It is much less expensive at $13.59 per 36 than the typical K-cups as well as being the best tasting coffee.  I love the French Roast.

This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.

The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the ""Keurig"" co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out.

The K-Cup format makes the trek much easier and enjoyable with the guarantee of a fresh tasting cup every time, as opposed to coffee beans that can go stall plus the convenience of drinking something different with each single cup if I desire.<br /><br />The journey brought me to San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser.  Having had the opportunity to travel I had experienced the the brand and was excited to see it ""available soon"" in K-Cups so I didn't hesitate to preorder.<br /><br />As I have come to rely on, Amazon delivered on time and I was anxious to try it the next morning.<br /><br />The Coffee (5 Stars)<br /><br />- Fog Chaser didn't fail to impress. In fact I would say it over delivered on quality based on my expectations - The rich full bodied taste and smooth finish made an excellent addition to my morning routine and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The Packaging (2 Stars)<br /><br />-  The K-Cupish like packaging, though innovative leaves room for improvement.  Instead of the traditional solid sealed K-Cup we have all grown use to the San Francisco Bay Coffee comes in a hybrid type packaging.  The coffee is held in a coffee filter material pouch that is attached to a K-Cup like top. It doesn't effect how you us it but it does effect a few other things.<br /><br />First off I seem to get more coffee grounds in my cup than I do with a traditional K-Cup.<br /><br />In addition the individual cups, because the coffee is exposed to air via the filter pouch freshness becomes an issue.  They come in the box sealed in an air tight bag but it is not resealable so once you open it the remaining coffee is exposed.  If this was the only coffee I drank it would probably not be an issue but because I jump around a lot it sits longer effecting the taste.  I guess I could place them in a resealable bag but call me lazy or cheap but I don't and feel I shouldn't have to.<br /><br />Lastly, though very nit-picky the individual cups will not sit in the coffee carousel I have on the counter next to the maker (you probably wouldn't want them to because of the freshness issue) but again it just makes it a little more inconvenient.<br /><br />As I drag myself into the kitchen after loosing the battle with my alarm clocks snooze button and I struggle in to make the first cup to get the caffeine flowing through my system I just don't like to work that hard at it.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />- The packaging itself will probably not keep me from reordering but it will be much less often than I would normally with some of my other favorites.<br /><br />So with all that said, if the packaging doesn't bother you or effect long term freshness, you are in for a very nice cup of coffee."

We do vacuum seal a canister with these once we open the plastic bag (the order came with 3 bags of 12 pods), to keep the coffee fresh (since they can't have the oxygen purged like a normal k-cup for freshness).

The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.

I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good."

I have used it for years and would not think of changing.  When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel."

This is then placed in a attractive retail type box<br />that would look right at home on the shelf next to kcups at your favorite retail store.<br />The front of the Box has a drawing of a kcup machine and a blow up of the 1 cup inserted in it.<br />It also lists a few of the compatible keurig type brewers it will work in.<br />The top and back of the box has some photos of environmental projects that the Rogers Family has been involved in.<br />one side has a photo of the rodgers family and their mission statement. The other side has a description of the coffee contained in the box.<br />I can see how these should sell well in the retail setting and also appeal to environment conscious individual and those who are just curious about a new alternative to the standard kcup.<br />I have a Box of Fog Chaser described on the box as a blend with the body of our regular roast and the smokiness of our French roast. A heavy full bodied with hints of cedar,vanilla and toasted almonds<br />balanced with a delicate finish with honey and milk chocolate flavors. Sure sounds appealing to me.<br />When I cut the seal on bag I'm hit with a very strong dark roast scent right away and something poignant but can't place the smell. Maybe it's the ceder they describe on the box and I'm intrigued to brew and try it.<br />Fits in my B70 perfectly and I use the 7.25 oz drop as I normally do. Smells good during brewing just like the extra bold dark roast Kcups I normally drink.<br />Brewed perfectly with no issues. Smells and tastes great in the Cup. Strong full bodied french roast with a smooth finish and I like it as does the wife.<br />I'm not one to name flavors and stuff like that so you will have to try it yourself for a more specific taste profile.

And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups.

These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the ""k-cups"" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I'm mostly neutral, but lean more toward ""would buy again""."

Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups.

Dark coffee that had a nice bite to it.  I will be ordering more products from this company as their coffee rocks the house. The price was better than the K cups and it is because, I suspect, the pods that they make are a plastic ring with the coffee encased in coffee filter paper.

After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others."

I use a clip to seal the bag back up after opening.  Maybe they could add a self seal bag type but then they would raise the price on me.  Leave it as is.<br /><br />2. Coffee was great.  Very bold just like I like it.  In fact it was better than the other bolds on my Amazon Subscribe and Save list.  This coffee pod just made the list.<br /><br />All I can say about the reviewers that did not like the bold taste is that perhaps they are only ""wanna be"" bold coffee drinkers.

Excellent taste and quality.,"I love coffee.<br /><br />I drink it in the morning, in the afternoon, and right before bed.  However I had yet to find a k-cup that gave me the full bodied taste that brewing a nice strong 1:1 ratio pot ever gave me.  I tried all the usual suspects.. green mountain, starbucks, caribou, donut, etc.  While I normally love their whole bean, ground, and coffee shop stuff.. I just could never find a full taste in any of them.  So, I gave up on k-cups and went back to my trusty home drip brewer.<br /><br />Then one day our company bought kuerig machines for the office.  So, I decided that I'd go out and try to find a decently priced k-cup, as anything tastes better than the sludge that they make in their industrial drip machines.  These are what I found, and whether it's the coffee, the lack of plastic on the bottom, or some combination, I'd have to say these K-Cups are the absolute closest thing I've found to a regular cup of coffee.  It bold, but not hit you over the head bold.  It isn't watered down.  It's perfect.<br /><br />Anyway, give them a try if you want a great cup of coffee for a great price.

The packaging is thoughtful, 8x 10 packs with a resealable cup for the open pack of coffee your working on. As far as taste its very good coffee, but strong ( fyi I drink coffee black like God intended). I typically make a 16 oz cup of coffee with one 'pouch' of coffee.

Some of the lesser-priced coffees claiming to work in a Keurig have not been so good. This coffee is excellent - and less expensive to boot! I'm picky about my coffee. I like a dark, bold roast, but find many to be bitter. This roast is smooth and flavorful.<br /><br />While I've not been really good about going out of my way to use ""greener"" products, I'm happy to buy a product that I really like and also happens to be more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />A couple of potential downsides with this new style of k-cup:<br /><br />1) since the filter part containing the coffee is more exposed than a traditional kcup that is encased completely in plastic, I suspect these SFB kcups may not stay fresh for very long. HOWEVER, in the 36-cup pack that I purchsed through Amazon, the company has seen fit to package the cups in 3 heavy, sealed plastic bags, so you only have to open, and expose to the air, 12 kcups at a time. Sidenote: the bag emits a WONDERFUL aroma when you open it!<br /><br />2) Also due to less plastic packaging over the filter, I notice more coffee ""sludge"" at the bottom of my cup than I see with traditional style kcups. This doesn't bother me. I just don't drink that last little bit in my cup. The coffee I DO drink is so rich and flavorful that this just isn't an issue for me.<br /><br />3) I take my new SFB kcups to work and use in the heavy-duty machine used there. Due to the smaller length of these kcups, some Keurig brewers don't recognize the cup as actually being there when you insert it in the basket. However, you can easily override this. When the machine says ""no kcup detected,"" it will usu. also say, ""continue? yes or no"" and you simply press yes. The machine will still function, as it would if you were using it simply to brew a cup of hot water.<br /><br />I will definitely order more of these kcups and am interested in trying other blends in addition to the Fog Chaser. Taste-wise, cost and ease of ordering: an all around ""win"" for me!"

I have always loved my the flavorful and bold 'one cup at a time' coffee faithfully brewed by my cherished <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009314RQ"">Gaggia 90501 Titanium SS Super Automatic Espresso and Cappuccino Machine, Stainless Steel</a>. After six years of faithful service my Gaggia developed an issue requiring it to be sent off for repair, so I purchased a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MZYZHU"">Breville BKC700XL Gourmet Single-Serve Coffeemaker with Iced-Beverage Function</a>. The Breville is intended to be an interim coffee maker while my beloved Italian Gaggia is sent off for repairs (a 3 month endeavor).<br /><br />I don't think of myself as a coffee snob, but I will admit to being particular about the coffee I drink. I was now faced with the challenge of finding some of my favorite coffees in the new to me K-Cup containers. As I came to the realization that my old favorite beans were not readily available in this medium I turned to Amazon buyer ratings as my guide in this java quest. I placed orders for both <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00461AF2W"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold 48 K-Cups</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TGDXMU"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Breakfast Blend, 80-Count</a> as a starting point. The SFB Breakfast Blend arrived first. I read all about the Rogers SF Bay family coffee business philosophy and their social give back and thought it was pretty cool. I then looked at their K-cups (OneCups) and thought to myself, ""is that how these things are supposed to look?"" Their OneCups take a more Eco-friendly construction approach so that you see a rounded filter bottom rather than the standard shaped plastic cup bottom. It all seemed interesting, but how would it taste? I thought the Breakfast Blend was really a lovely cup of coffee. The smooth medium-dark roast Central and South American beans are very tasty indeed! I would venture to say that it is on par with any of the very best medium-dark roast coffees available. I would never turn my nose up at it, that is certain. However my personal pallet preference is for something a bit more dark and bold. Three days later I received the Emeril's Big Easy Bold order and immediately tried it. It certainly delivered on all aspects of a robust dark roast with full flavor. It is a bold, dark, classic Parisian roast, in your face brew, just the way I like it. However I find it to have an ever so slight unpleasant aftertaste and a not too far away from, but not quite there bitter finish. Again this is just according to my palette, you may not think so. All in all it is a very good coffee.<br /><br />The SFB Fog Chaser arrived and I couldn't wait to try it out. I cut the seal on bag and was hit with the scent of a strong dark roast. I placed the now familiar OneCup container in the machine and hit brew. Immediately the aromas hit my nose and let me know that I was in for a treat. Fog Chaser is a strong full bodied French Roast with an extremely smooth finish. It is certainly bolder than Breakfast Blend, but is not as bold as Emeril's Big Easy Bold. The taste is full, smooth and well rounded without any unpleasant bitterness or aftertaste at all. I wouldn't have minded if the yield had been slightly stronger though. My next order will be <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> to see how it compares to these three. Until that time, I give SFB Fog Chaser two big thumbs up!! It is currently at the top of my K-cup coffee taste experience."

My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder.

This coffee is strong, but not too strong, and good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.

I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups.

This pod uses at least 1/3 of the plastic of the standard K-Cup: There is a plastic ring holding the mesh coffee filter pod to the foil cap. Environmentally, this is a step in the right direction.

No coffee, no matter if it's whole bean, refrigerated, or in fancy packaging will retain the same flavor profile it had in the first weeks after it's roasted.  Coffee should be drunk in about 2-3 days after it's roasted and for about another 2-4 weeks.  The majority of flavor in coffee comes from it's aromatics, and they are gone in a relatively short period of time.

Here's my take on the Fog Chaser after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer the French Roast, but I like a darker roast. This has a fruity undertone, similar to a Breakfast Blend, that I personally don't care for. But, my husband likes it and I find it drinkable.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is pretty strong, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like darker roasts but most people don't, and this is a little more bold than mild. There is a not-totally-pleasant aftertaste, but not enough to not drink it.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine."

This is absolutely the best deal I've found anywhere online for any K-Cups, and this brand has proven to be of excellent quality as well (I've also ordered French Roast Decaf and was happy with those too!).<br /><br />Because these have a filter-type bottom, you will have to keep them in a sealed bag or container once the individual bag has been opened to keep them at optimal freshness, but this is easy to do and, in my opinion, not a big deal.<br /><br />Great price + great taste = great value.

I served it to five people at the office because I personally love it.  Two of them said they couldn't finish the cup, while the other three thought it was the best they've had. I personally like the more traditional taste of brewed coffee that this product produces.  The plastic k-cups always seemed to have an awkward taste to them, almost as if I wasn't really drinking coffee.  I do get a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the cup, but also don't mind that.  Since it does turn the inside of my white cup pretty black, I suppose I should also start thinking about what it's doing to my teeth and my insides, but the flavor seems to make it all worthwhile anyhow.  At the office it was clearly a love it or hate it type reaction - this from four people who usually choose a bold coffee and one who always drinks light (but happened to love this)."

If anything, these are probably a bit more environmentally-friendly than standard K-Cups simply by virtue of containing far less plastic.<br /><br />The only problem is, they just don't taste that good.  The coffee itself leaves something to be desired, surprising considering the history of the company that makes these. (full disclosure: I worked briefly for these folks back in the late '70s. Since I have a personal connection to the products, I really wanted to like them) I liked this better than the Rainforest Blend (which I found weak and watery) but not as much as the French Roast. (which I didn't really care for that much when I first tasted it, but found it grew on me as I worked my way through the case and compared it with other K-Cups)<br /><br />Keep in mind that this review is based on a single cup, and I didn't really like the French Roast when I first tasted it either, so you might want to take this with a grain of salt until I've had a few more opportunities to sample the product and compare it to other varieties.  I'll update if my opinion changes with time, but on first try, I doubt I'd buy this again.  It's better than the Rainforest Blend, but I'd be more likely to buy the French Roast than this.<br /><br />Like other One Cup varieties, these leave a bit more sediment in the bottom of the cup and produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam floating on top of a good cup of coffee - than most traditional K-Cups.  The Fog Chaser seems to produce less than either the French Roast or the Rainforest Blend, for what it's worth. I found the flavor just a little on the thin and bitter side."

I always felt kind of guilty putting so many plastic cups in the garbage. Now to the coffee it is absolutely the best I have had.  A 10oz cup is possible without tasting too watery, especially with the French roast.  Every one of the Rogers family cups are great.  The fog chaser is a little smoother than the french roast but nice and dark.  The french roast is great also not quite as bitter as the usual french roast even the decaf is great.  This coffee rivals fresh brewed easily and is less expensive which is a bonus for those of us who want the freedom of K cups but don't like the price.

Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling."

Or at least I did not find the secret yet revealed.  I love Amazon.com and am a high volume customer but folks, you can get this product at COSTCO at a significant savings.  An 80 count box at COSTCO is just around $30; unit cost is about 34 cents.  Do not hesitate because of the 80 count box.  The contents are packed 8 units to a heavy duty sealed nitrogen filled bag that will hold for over a year.  You will find the 'good until' date clearly printed on each bag.  When you cut open the bag (you will need scissors) the phenomenal fragrance of freshly ground French Roast coffee comes right at you.  If you like that rich smell of fresh ground, this will be almost as good as when you drink it after brewing.<br /><br />So is this a good coffee?  I am an old restaurant guy and I always prefer my coffee rich, dark and not bitter.  I tried virtually all the K-cup samplers available so I could do a comparison of the DARKS, BOLDS and FRENCH ROASTS I could find.  Other than a few Sumatra brews, this SF BAY product stood out at the top of the list.  That even includes the really expensive stuff that is good but not good enough to be price competitive or flavor superior. If you do not at least try this coffee in your K-Cup brewer, you are missing a unique opportunity for quality and value.  If you shop at COSTCO, you need to look for it and get the best competitive single serve French Roast around town.  You will also find that San Francisco Bay bulk coffees have been sold at COSTCO for a very long time.<br /><br />Now, about that little filter material container in place of the plastic cup you are used to seeing.  Well, the Rodgers Family who produce all the San Francisco Bay Coffees (and other labels), are independent and want us all to get their premium coffees without having to pay the Royalties to use the ""K-Cup"" brand name...and they do not want to infringe on copyright designs, so they were inspired to have this design created.  The entire container portion of the unit is indeed a filter and allows for the best extraction methodology.<br /><br />You must be asking yourself if I am a ""shill"" for this company and the answer is an emphatic NO.  I am just a life long student of consumer economics and I really like to give credit when and where it is earned.  The Rodgers family business is located in Lincoln, California in the vicinity of where I live - and I also like to support my local business.<br /><br />You may forget all about what I have said here, but you will always remember San Francisco Bay French Roast once you have tasted it."

However, after receiving them and brewing a couple of cups of coffee I can say that there was no need to worry. I would describe this coffee as Medium roast, maybe leaning towards dark. It has a nice distinctive flavor, and the Amazon Frustration Free packaging really is frustration free. We store our open cups in a sealed container to help maintain freshness.

I love that they are not as destructive to the environment as the others.

Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.<br /><br />I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.

He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.

The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what ""smell"" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.

It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.

We all know (and love) the ease of popping in a cup, pressing the brew button, and tossing the cup afterwards.  So easy!  However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.

It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.

I was skeptical at first because the pictures showed a lack of complete shell for the coffee, and I wasn't sure how the pressure brewing would work.  But I must say that this coffee has more aroma, strength and flavor than most Keurig brewed coffees.  It comes in small bags, containing 12 each.  I usually transfer them to a freezer bag right away once I open each bag.  This helps keep the flavor a little more.

Living alone I love K-cups ability to brew a single cup instead of wasting a whole pot. I have tried dozens of different K-cups and all of them made a decent cup of coffee but when I really wanted something good I had to use the french press. These K-cups are by far the best. I love opening up a bag of them and smelling that sweet smell of coffee, something you just don't get with the plastic ones. The taste of these is bolder and stronger than even the most potent plastic version. Lastly these will biodegrade a lot quicker than the plastic ones making them better for the environment.<br /><br />One last quick tip: Put them in a ziplock to retain that fresh ground coffee smell and taste."

He agrees that it is good, and a bargain too!  This product comes in three individual, sealed bags, each with 12 cups, so I think this helps keep it fresh.

I also picked up a case of Starbucks Cafe Verona and I prefer the Fog Chaser. It has a wonderful aroma and a bold but not harsh flavor that I really enjoy. The slight inconvenience of having to keep it in a air tight bag to keep it fresh is mitigated by the excellent flavor and price. It's a good trade-off.

They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out."

When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day.

It's possible that these could have freshness issues if left out for several days/weeks. I don't think my supply will last long enough to go bad though. I like the idea of less plastic - I like to compost my coffee grounds in the summer and these have much easier access to dumping out the grounds. (I can just tear open the mesh bag.) They fit in the Keurig and brew just fine.<br /><br />In fact, I usually buy the strongest coffee k-cups so I can ""double-brew"" mine into a bigger mug. True coffee aficionados may not prefer this.

Folks, I have tried so many varieties from Instant to Drip to K cups, and the list goes on.  Hopefully, the reader gets the picture...I love my coffee.  Yet, I am not sure what this ""stuff"" is.  Here is my experience...<br /><br />First, I get the shipment.  Open it up, and I must admit, I do like the nice box the coffee arrives in.  I do appreciate the added note on the box from the Robinson Family along with their mission statement.<br /><br />""Taste the Difference - Make a Difference - Community Aid Program"" and there is more information on the side of the box which really sort of made me ""feel good"" about my purchase.  The Robinson Family goes on to state ""Offering the best value to you, our customer.  Treating our employees, suppliers, and customers as if they were part of our family.""  I mean all this really made me feel good and I was glad I had purchased a product where a ""family"" supported others...<br /><br />Yet, that is where it ended.  I opened the box, cut open the plastic sealed containers this ""cups"" come in, and grabbed my first little strange looking but new looking ""k cup"".  Please note, as others have said, these are completely different than an actual ""k cup"", but I thought unique and liked the design....<br /><br />UNTIL...yes, UNTIL...I hate to write this, but the very first thing I noted on the side of this ""bag cup"" was something that looked like a bug!!  It politely dropped in the palm of my hand, and since it was not ""wiggling"", I figured I could examine it very closely.  I did....<br /><br />YUCK!  It was some sort of freaking small, slim BUG!!  I thought maybe it was my ole' eyes, but had my son examine it and he confirmed my verdict....<br /><br />Did I go ahead and try the coffee???  Well, again, I hate to admit this, but I figured the bug could not ""kill"" me, so yes...I went ahead and tried the other ""cup"" things (honestly, I don't know what to call these little cups"").  My first reaction was just ""disgust""...The flavor was weak and the cream and sugar simply diluted to the bottom of the cup.  Nothing like the Rev K Cups or other K cups I had used...<br /><br />So, I went to the computer to write a review...no, not today I thought...I wanted to be fair, because, again, I felt a part of the ""Family"" the manufacturer had written about on the box...and maybe the ""bug"" was still in my mind!<br /><br />Thus, here I sit today several days later, and just finished another of these cups....and after using a few of the things...I just honestly cannot understand why all the high positives written by other reviewers?  Honestly?  I am trying to like these things due to the price and the ""Family"" caring thing...but, this coffee is simply too weak and does not taste like ""coffee"" to me.  In comparison, it sort of reminds me of an off the wall instant coffee on the weak scale...<br /><br />Folks, all of you who have written such positive reviews...trust me, I want to be open minded...I want to like this coffee.  I tried smaller cups on my K cup machine, and it simply gets worse...<br /><br />So, in conclusion, maybe I got a ""bad box""?  I mean should there have been a ""bug"" in it to begin with??  Even with that...get past the bug issue...where is the flavor?  Why does the cream and sugar simply dissolve to the bottom of the cup leaving a bad looking residue as you get to the last sip?  It dissolves ""into the coffee"" with other brands...<br /><br />I love the price, and wish I could like this...is there another type other than the ""Fog Chaser""???  Would like to stay with the Robinson Family, but not left in the ""Fog"" as this is sort of how I feel trying to drink this coffee .....""Fog Chaser""????  Well, I am definitely ""chasing the Fog""...trying to understand how this is called ""coffee""????<br /><br />I will continue through this box the best I can, and ""if"" I find one of the cups different, then in all fairness, I will update this review to treat the ""Robinson Family"" fair...And yes, I guess maybe I am crazy to drink through all these things since the bug was on the first one, but I figure the hot water should kill any harmful bacteria...hope I am right??  But, again, I want to emphasize, it is not the ""bug"" that is causing my dislike of this ""wattery, weak...very odd coffee""....."

They are to be used in the Keurig machines but have a filter casing, not plastic like the regular K- cups, which is not a problem.  The coffee tasted terrible. The date was fresh, so it wasnt that the coffee was old. I will never again waste my money on this brand.  I cant understand why the company would put out a product like this and expect it to sell, I for one will never buy it again.

83671,83672,B005ZBZLT4,A3P7U2VHXKJESY,J.P.,0,3,2,1326412800,"Good coffee, not a K-Cup","While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more ""exposed"" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this ""OneCup"" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a ""house"" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant."

Barkan ""Holly B.""",2,2,3,1343606400,"Not the best, not the worst.","I recently ordered this because I was excited about the reduced plastic in the packaging. Interestingly, the day I ordered it my husband came home with the same brand from the grocery store, so I've now tried 2 different flavors. I would give both the same review. The coffee is okay. It's not horrendous, as some people seem to imply, and its not amazing either. The smell is good and smells like nice fresh coffee when you open the box. The flavor is nice enough too. I also love super strong coffee. I drink Revv, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, etc. I would not say that this coffee rivals them, but it is stronger than some other medium roast coffees.<br /><br />Big reasons why I wouldn't give this 5 stars:<br /><br />1) The coffee gets very watered down when brewed on a larger cup size. I usually do the 10 oz size and this coffee just doesn't cut it for that. I feel it becomes more like coffee flavored water at that point. 8 oz is better, but its ideal at 6 oz. So, now I just save it for when I want a small cup.<br /><br />2) There is a strange film that brews with the coffee. You can see it floating on top and it sticks to the sides of the mug when you tilt it, so there is like a ring of residue that gets left around the edge where the coffee moved away. You can also see it as darker specks floating on top after you add creamer. I don't know what this is. I have no other coffee that does this. It doesn't really change the taste or texture or anything, but I just don't like it.<br /><br />I think the packaging is a big plus though. I am not sure why the cups being open is such an issue for people. I just put all mine in a zip lock bag (that I can just keep reusing) to keep it air tight. It's really not that difficult. Plus I think it's important to cut down on plastic waste.<br /><br />So all in all, I do plan to buy this coffee again. I like that I can reduce waste and I like it enough that its good for a midday refresher since it has to be a small cup. We are also on a tight budget so that helps as well. However, I don't see myself replacing all my coffee with it, because I want a much larger and stronger cup of coffee in the morning and brewing two of these eliminates both the value and the positive aspects of less waste."

Jacobson,2,2,5,1330819200,Great value.,"I believe this coffee tastes as good as any brand of K-Cup I've ever tried while currently costing about a third less (using subscribe and save on Amazon).  It actually tastes fresher to me than other K-Cups, possibly because it arrives packed in a plastic bag which seems airtight until opened."
83699,83700,B005ZBZLT4,A1GRFKOIAYG1C6,"John Morrison ""Curmudgeon""",2,2,5,1330646400,"Not your average K-cup, but worth a taste","I have my concerns about this coffee's packaging, but the important part first: It tastes good. Fog Chaser is a little more robust than I like for a morning blend (I tend toward a Dunkin Donuts style coffee first thing in the AM), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. The nonstandard pods fit into my B70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) Grove Square. Yes, I'd buy these again.<br /><br />Now the negatives. As has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. There's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. I've heard concerns about the Keurig success causing more spent K-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; I'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. So a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />However, one of the charms of Keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: I've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. Oxygen is the enemy of coffee. Old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. Keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the San Francisco Bay Coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. The bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. After all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (I can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. If you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, I'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />My concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the Keurig system is a godsend. For example, I dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when I visited. Having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. These, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />So in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. Keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. Companies that go through a whole lot of K-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most K-cups."

I'm always looking to mix up my selection because that is one of the true benefits of the Keurig machines. I read the reviews trying to determine how dark/strong Fog Chaser was and could not quite nail down the strength. I relied on the name and thankfully knew about the packaging. I keep mine in a canister after realizing I had an extra one to spare, which will keep the air out. I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br /><br />Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br /><br />I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe."

While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma.

Anbinder ""14850.com editor""",36,53,2,1324512000,"WARNING - open mesh coffee pods, NOT K-Cups","I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box."

Yes it is nice that the product uses less plastic but that is only a side note the quality of the coffee is top notch.

That being said, it did not stop us from drinking it all, but I do have to wonder which is the abnormality! I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a ""crema"" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!).

Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more ""green"" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging.

I'm a bargain hunter and have considered going back to my drip coffee due to the rising prices of K cups.I read all the reviews,and feeling there was nothing to lose I debated between French Roast and Fog Chaser. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser did not disappoint (haven't tried the French Roast yet). Fog Chaser is a moderatly bold coffee, smooth, with no hint of bitterness. As for the skeptics concerned with the ""netted"" base of the cup affecting taste and freshness...the product is packaged in mini packs ( sealed thick plastic) of 8 cups to protect freshness. In addition, I feel the netting (not flimsy by any means) offers a better fitration system that the typical K cup. I only write reviews about products that excite me, or repulse me. Obviously, I am a San Francisco Bay Coffee fan. If you choose to try this product, I'm pretty sure you will be pleasantly surprised."

I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!"

I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable."

They were everything a lemon drop should be: A sugary entrance, developing into a deeply satisfying, soul-stirring essence of pure lemon. The mouth-watering joy of the lemon drop is seductive and addictive, and I am nearly certain that sucking on these golden gems made Kurosawa's ""Savage Dogs"" even more enjoyable.<br /><br />They're hard candies. but not so hard that you couldn't cheat and bite into one, breaking it up into ten or so smaller candies, zig-zagging around your mouth like offshoots from a single magnificent fireworks explosion.<br /><br />One 2-ounce tin lasted longer than the 2 hours or so of Kurosawa's brilliant detective drama, one of his first with Toshiro Mifune, who once again delivers a compelling performance.  Although the packaging is a bit precious, there's nothing pretentious about the taste of Les Citrons, and as for value, these drops are the working man or woman's workhorse.  They're far less expensive than other candy (to say nothing of popcorn), and their staying power is extraordinary.<br /><br />Still, this vendor charges more than some others, and with the added shipping fee one may wish to purchase these  at a local outlet (or occupying it until your lemon drop demands are met). If you're serious about your lemon drops, tt's Paris 1968 all over again.<br /><br />Nutritional Information per Package (30 pieces; you could try to eat the suggested serving size of 3 drops, but I find this highly unlikely). 240 calories, no fat or sodium, 60 grams carbohydrates, 60 grams of sugar, no protein, and no trace of food allerges.

Being a tea drinker I inquired about good english teas and they gave me a napkin with the names of bewleys tea on it and about 6 teabags for me to try. I put the napkin in my back pocket and the teabags got wrapped up in an old sandwich bag and put in my wife's purse. We parted with the nice english couple and as we traveled around disneyworld it began to rain that afternoon and we got soaking wet. I found what was left of the napkin that evening at the hotel and it was unreadable. About 6 months later at home the bag fell out of my tea closet as i was fixing to make a cup and I decided to finally try the tea those nice folks from england raved about. I loved the tea and I believe I have finally found it in bewleys. Some of the best tea I have had. The english surely know their tea.

I do not have to put in extra because it is full bodied and stands up to cream and sugar wonderfully.  I have been drinking it in the morning and have been using the Yorkshire Gold for the afternoon. Bewley's is my favorite now, not that Yorkshire Gold sucks or anything but I like it strong.  I will still search for another tea perhaps as good. Life is an adventure and you never know when you're going to bingo.<br /><br />If you like a strong, not bitter brew try Bewley's!  After you've had Irish it is hard to go back, teawise that is."

After giving my dogs these chews, my 3 month old puppy threw up the treat. By the next day at lunch time, he was exhibiting neurotoxic symptoms. We immediately took him to the vet for blood work, which all came back below normal limits. He was given IV therapy and monitored over night. Over the next two days, my older dogs (ages 4, 7 and 9)began vomiting and acting lethargic, but with no neurological symptoms. We traced the cause back to these chews, as it is the only coomon thing among all the dogs (puppy eats different food than adult dogs, puppy is walked on a leash not allowed to run around in yard yet, puppy is not out of his crate unless he is beig observed, etc.). After speaking with someone at a pet store, we learned some rawhide chews are pressed with water, while others are pressed with formaldehyde. While it is not listed which method these use, we are concerned it is the formaldehyde. In the case of the older dogs, their GIs are rejecting them due to the toxins. With the puppy, his immature renal and hepatic system exhibited neurotoxicity."

No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think ""sponge"" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!<br /><br />I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!<br /><br />I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects.

It not only has to be rehydrated in a particular way, but also will not taste good without proper cooking to flavor and soften it. Even at that point, it will have a chewy, slightly spongey texture, but if cut and cooked appropriately, it is not a strange texture and is very delicious as a side dish.<br /><br />Google recipes for Koyadofu and try one that involves simmering it (after rehydration) in a broth made of katsuobushi (if you are not vegetarian -- if you are, then use mushroom or vegie stock), shouyu or tamari, mirin, and a little sweetner. My child loves this, and I pack it in her school lunch box along with rice, and some vegies that have been simmered in the same broth."

Melitta's French vanilla flavor, however, is my least favorite of the Melitta flavored coffees (behind hazelnut and morning decadence). I find that the flavor is too overwhelming and cloying. For those who like strong flavor, this will be a hit, but I find that I have to mix it (1 spoon of flavored to 2 spoons of regular) in order to enjoy it."

Fortunately, Melitta knows that feeling with their coffees, and make them well from the heart. Their French Vanilla is a delightful tast that just melts your heart away. It is delicious after the first cup, and just everlasting. My one and only gripe with Melitta though is that with their ground coffees is that they are very hard to open the cans, considering you'd have to use a regular can opener to get them open, rather than peel the top off from Folgers or Maxwell House. That definitely is the only thing that is not only frustrarting, but can easily cause the consumer to break the can.

Toll ""Snackin' Nut""",1,1,5,1351036800,Good To The Last Drop!!,"If you love good medium-roasted and well balanced coffee then you will love Melitta.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. Melitta only uses the top 2% of the world's supply of 100% Arabica coffee and it tastes it. (and NO, I don't work for the company!) Arabica is the finest grade of coffee available on the market.  The other grade, ""Robusto"" is generally less expensive, lower quality and used by most other major coffee processors such as Chock Full O' Nuts, Folgers, Maxwell House and almost all generic and store brands to name a few).<br /><br />2. The 11.5 oz. cans are nitrogen-flushed and well-sealed to retain its integrity and fresh roasted flavor upon opening. I have found consistently that coffee packaged in plastic or paper bags or pouches DOES NOT, in my opinion, retain its flavor and freshness well.<br /><br />3. If you have a drip coffee maker (Like Bunn, Mr. Coffee or others), Melitta's fine grind works exceptionally well. Remember...the finer the grind, the more flavor you will extract from the coffee. In addition, the finer the grind, the more efficiently your coffee maker will use coffee. Since you can generally use less coffee per cup, Melitta is a winner for price per ounce.<br /><br />4. Melitta seems to be a very transparent and consumer responsible company. They place clear ""Best By"" dates on the bottom of each of their products.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Some of Melitta's flavors, like French Vanilla and a seasonally-offered coffee called ""Morning Decadence"", are very hard to find but well worth investigating and sampling if you have a chance.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />The best commercially available coffee for drip coffee makers. Outstanding grind, well-balanced flavors and consistent freshness can after can."

I have four Chihuahuas of my own and a fifth as a foster, and I spent a long time researching foods to make a switch after P&G took over Natura (we were on Innova).  My female can be picky and does horribly with food pieces that are too big, so I was thrilled when I saw the thin triangles in the bag.  She happily crunches right through them, which is great, since she and one of my boys have horrible teeth and having to chew the food helps.<br /><br />My alpha male has been on Hills C/D almost all his life because he was diagnosed with struvite crystals as a young dog (he is almost 11 now).  He was the only one of my pack who looked old.  Dull coat, dandruff, and a gaunt look to his face and body.  I knew it had to be the food, so looked at all the levels and decided on the Whitefish formula as a food trial, hoping he wouldn't develop crystals again on a hollistic food.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  He looks fantastic, he and the female (same age) are more active, and I'm happy to report that after 2.5 months, his urinalysis was clean!<br /><br />Our third dog and our foster dog both have very course hair, and since starting this food, they have both become much softer.  Everyone is shiny and (before the weather got so dry) dandruff-free!  Best of all, each and every one of the dogs is absolutely CRAZY about the taste of the food, and even my girl who we used to have to push to finish her dinner now eats with everyone else in under two minutes and then licks the crumbs up off her eating blanket.  It's truly miraculous.  I couldn't be any happier with this food.  It may cost more than the lower quality foods, but if you added all the supplements it would take to get this level of nutrition, you'd be spending more anyway.  Love it, love it, LOVE IT!"

I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).

I pried open the bottle and took a sniff, wherein I noticed a slightly herbal scent; considering the long list of herbal ingredients on the label, this wasn't particularly suprising.  I then poured the nearly blood red elixir into a cup and took an initial swallow.  I was rather suprised by the initial bitterness of the soda; it definitely wasn't what I was expecting!  Continuing with a couple more swallows, I then started to notice a slight burning sensation in my esophagus -- this, no doubt, came from the jalape&ntilde;o oil that was infused into the beverage.  I wasn't sure if I liked this soda at first.  However, the more that I drank it, the more that I came to enjoy this bizarre concoction.  It also seemed to cure my morning craving for caffeine, so that was pretty cool too.  My co-workers weren't so thrilled with this beverage, but I thought that it was pretty good.

I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says ""Very Hot"", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called ""Bufalo"" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff."

83940,83941,B000FNJ5JO,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,Zoe Paris,41,43,4,1168300800,Best Matcha in this price range!,"This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea.<br /><br />Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality.<br /><br />Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!<br /><br />Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!"

The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source:<br /><br />Caffeine<br /><br />Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.<br /><br />Enough said.........enjoy your tea............."

I am currently a matcha neophyte but I noticed that the expensive matcha tasted significantly better, seemed more fresh, and had a better brighter color.  I use one heaping teaspoon per pint of hot water, and unfortunately with the more expensive variety it costs over five dollars per pint of matcha tea when you use this much.  Even so, if you can afford it, seek out the finer grades of matcha straight from Uji Japan.  The Uji region is famous for their fine Gyokuro tea and superior grades of matcha.  If you don't have that kind of money, this matcha could suffice, but try to get the Uji-based premium matchas, especially for special occasions.  This matcha is listed as being from Uji, but it isn't as good as the more expensive varieties from the same area."

A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I've been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I'd try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don't get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It's a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don't get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it's nothing or simply too much.  I know, I'm giving a lot of words here.  It's just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven't found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it's either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I'm tossing it in the garbage because it's too much a pain at meal time when I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't say it's awful because maybe it's us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don't get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I'll take a stand and say - we don't like it.  I've tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.  Going back to Morton's course kosher salt or our sea salt bought locally in Maine until I find that salt that matches the gift from Hawaii..."

The flavor is really bright and enhances quite a few dishes, from meats to veggies and even desserts. I decided to buy some for my home recently here. I find it is better used as a finisher, i.e.  sprinkled on foods. I also use it in seafood rubs quite often. My favorite uses are sprinkled on fresh veggies such as cucumber slices and heirloom tomatoes, on chocolate/caramel dishes, and used with seafood. I have several salts, so i generally use this for those three purposes, but sometimes, I'll add it to other dishes as well. It doesnt really dissolve quickly (probably due to the red clay which gives it its color), so it is better used in dishes where that isnt an expectation. Otherwise, it is multifunctional and i think you'll like it. Enjoy!"

That explains its color, its slowness to dissolve, and its flavor. I have no idea whether the clay adds any nutritional value to the salt, but it has a certain Biblical resonance. ""Clay thou art, Adam!"" In fact, the name 'adam' is derived from the Hebrew word for clay.<br /><br />This is the only 'boutique' sea salt I've come upon that seems well worth the extra cost. It's extremely tasty on heirloom tomatoes. It looks appetizing on steaks and chops, sprinkled at the last moment before serving. It's something to reserve for ""finishing"" and ""plating"" food. A six-ounce jar will last a long time in most kitchens, so this is a decent value.<br /><br />If you live in the South, you might try sprinkling alaea sea salt on the tail of the next ivory-billed woodpecker or Carolina parroquet you see, as a means of clearing the land for development."

Get this one and you can feel stellar! lol<br /><br />Now as for taste, I am not one who has had a lot of passion fruit in their life, other than in smoothies I have got from smoothie places and those are usually so riddled with sugars and other fruits picking out the passion fruit itself was a little difficult especially not having passion fruit in and of itself.<br /><br />Now I get to taste real passion fruit! Yay!<br /><br />It has a bit of this natural rind like flavor similar to that you sometimes get in a mango or papaya. Fruits I do have personal experience with. I like it though - it really compliments the natural grassy like flavor of the matcha base! And contrary to the smoothies I have had its not that sweet. There is a tart flavor to it but not bitter. It tastes REALLY healthy, and while matcha is always healthy sometimes I feel guilty having my dessert like matcha lol although I shouldn't such as my favorite butterscotch mathca makes me feel like I'm cheating haha this one makes me feel like I am really doing something good for my body and trust me my body needs all the help it can get!<br /><br />The aroma of this one is really quite nice! It is very eye opening and even if its only a mental thing I sure can use that in the mornings!<br /><br />There is the after taste of the rind like flavor but the passion fruit flavor makes my mouth water for more, literally, as if the juices itself are pulling out the watery mouth sensation! Its strange but nice. Its like having a mouth full of juicy passion fruit!<br /><br />So I drank half of my matcha straight, then added some sparkling italian water and some sweet cream non dairy creamer to make an italian soda and OMG goodness! The flavors ERUPT into a juicy fruit gum sensation which is similar in some ways to the brandy matcha I am going to review next! It is different though as the brandy also has alcohol notes to it whereas this one does not. This is like the virgin variable you give your kids while you have the brandy one haha. Except this has that lovely awakening rind flavor in the background that lingers in the after taste."

Red Leaf's passionfruit matcha is not one of them. This delicious tropical fruit flavor definitely shines alongside the base matcha. I prefer this matcha cold, though I plan to try it hot come winter. It'll be perfect for summer daydreaming, because there's something about the flavor of passionfruit that screams summer. It's well captured in this matcha. The flavor isn't heavy, but I do find that just the slightest touch of milk/cream really rounds out the cup. Another hit from Red Leaf!"
84076,84077,B000Y0M2MA,A3F6UPPU8W8J0U,A,0,0,1,1313625600,"I wouldn't call them ""cookies"". Also, the label language is obscure.","These don't have an appropriate texture to be called ""cookies"". The ingredients aren't blended well, so it feels more like a granola bar to me, and I've always hated granola bars (even when I was unaware of their harmful effects on human health). They also smell artificially, which interferes with the perception of their taste... although I can't tell if they have any taste, besides some sweetness. Where did orange, ginger, and chocolate go?<br /><br />It's also irritating that the manufacturer doesn't talk about the ingredients in a simple and straightforward manner. Why say ""low glycemic monosaccharide"" and ""low glycemic fruit concentrate""? Admit that it is FRUCTOSE. It is not enough to say ""vegetable fiber"". They are supposed to know exactly WHAT KIND of fiber they use, because it makes a difference."
84077,84078,B000Y0M2MA,A1WX42M589VAMQ,Mir,0,0,4,1310947200,"Really Lovely Taste. My fave low-carb cookie, and it's GLUTEN FREE and doesn't make for tummy rumbles.","These taste GREAT. These don't have gluten. These are lower carb. These have no sugar. JACKPOT!<br /><br />I searched quite a while to find a treat/snack/dessert that I could enjoy on my diet and my once-sugar-addict hubby could enjoy so he doesn't feel deprived. I do carb controlled ""Primarian"" type dieting (mostly protein and veggies, with some cheese/yogurt, fruit and nuts/nut butters, no sugar (rarely, anyway), no gluten. I've given up most grains and have lost 110 lbs. Hubby is nearly underweight eating this way, so he gets extra snacks/treats.) So, I really had a hard time finding certain convenient (ie, I don't have to make it!) dessert items. These cookies solved my dilemma.<br /><br />I like the Orange Ginger Chocolate best, followed by the Island Lime. I found the peanut butter ones had a weird oily flavor. My super picky hubby likes the Cinni-Apple Spice. We've reordered these multiple times in the last few months, usually 4 or 6  bags at a time of EACH the three flavors. It gets really expensive, but it consolidates shipping. At 2 to 3 cookies at a time as a post-dinner or post-lunch dessert, it keeps me sane. Seriously, while I love fruit for dessert, sometimes, I just want me something that TASTES like I'm having pure old-fashioned junk. :D<br /><br />The texture is the only thing that could be improved on my fave two flavors. (I find the Cinni-Apple spice fine, but blander than I prefer, hence my preference for the others.) Some batches are nicely crispy. Others are chewy and stuck-together. I think they don't handle transport in the summer heat too well or the moisture levels in summer, cause my order earlier in the year were much nicer (ie, during the cooler/drier months). But even with the chewier texture and less crispness the flavor shines.<br /><br />Island Lime is mis-named. They should just call it Coconut Citrus. It's mostly coconut. It tasted 90% coconut to me with a hint of the citrus. Suits me fine. I adore coconut cookies (ie, the old sugary ones I used to get). So, if you expect heavy lime, sorry. If you love coconut, go for it. I judge most items I buy by the first five ingredients. Sure, the others count, but those are the BULK of what makes a lot of items, so here goes for Island Lime: Almonds, whey protein concentrate, unsweetened coconut, egg whites, vegetable fiber.  Very low-carb friendly stuff. It's 79 calories per serving of 2 cookies, 4 grams of fiber, 1 sugar, and 2 grams of protein.<br /><br />My fave, the Orange Ginger Chocolate taste like a bit of chocolate met a bit of Cointreau and had a baby. It's not a heavy choco taste. It's not really all that gingery. Just a bit. And the citrus reminds me of my earlier years when I sipped Cointreau at parties. Same texture issues, but the taste is a treat to me with coffee. Really satisfies. The nutritional profile didn't please me as much as the Island Lime, but hey, you sometimes just need that treat. First Five: Almonds, Whey protein concentrate, egg whites, vegetable fiber, maltodextrin.  It's 74 calories for 2 cookies (an acceptable amount on my 1200 to 1400 calorie diet), and it has 3 grams of fiber,  1 sugar, and 3 grams of protein per serving.<br /><br />I don't get intestinal distress like I do with some low-carb/diet stuff with sugar substitutes, which is another bonus. And the fiber content pleases me, too.<br /><br />If you miss having cookie on your diet and need to avoid gluten, here ya go. Enjoy.<br /><br />I would note that Netrition has a better price on these and reasonable shipping. Wish Amazon would stock and sell these. I order these a lot and it would save me loads to get it on my Prime list of items. Oh, well. Worth trying, no matter the vendor."

I tried to order it with upgraded shipping but, after I got Amazon's confirmation, it showed standard shipping and could take 8 days, given the intervening federal holiday and weekend.  Seeing that, I emailed La Costa Gourmet to see if the shipping could be upgraded to 2-day.  Within five minutes--I kid you not, 5 minutes!!!, Jeff at La Costa Gourmet called me, assuring that the order was due to go out first thing in the morning and is expected to arrive in two days, no need for an additional shipping fee.  I know that the order for one pound of coffee seems like a small matter but, it is for a family member heading overseas.  This small matter was very important to me and obviously very important to La Costa Gourmet.  They have earned my undying loyalty for customer service, great communication, & not ripping me off for an additional shipping fee."

""What, pray tell, are those"" I queried?  ""Sardines,"" he said, to which I replied ""No.""  We settled the dispute by fishing out the can from the garbage and ascertaining that it did indeed state 'Sardines' on the label.  I was flabbergasted, having had no idea that a sardine can be as large as a plate as th0se were, or as small as a pinkie finger as many of these King Oscar Tiny Tots are....but let's face it:  Nobody wants to eat a humongous sardine.  In fact, doing so is antithetical to the meaning of the small fish, it's oxymoronic, and downright distasteful to do so, possibly even disrespectful.<br /><br />In the years since then whenever I got the craving for sardines I would buy a can of them, usually in mustard sauce, then catch myself thinking that I remembered sardines being tiny fish packed, well, like sardines in a can, and the ones I was buying seemed relatively large....generally as large as the can was wide and meaty such that they would quite overwhelm the saltine cracker I placed them on, and they tasted like fish.  I'm not complaining, I'm from a state that was famous for its sardines and the ones I was eating were often caught and processed there....I just thought that Sardines were, by their nature, tiny.<br /><br />It turns out that the name Sardine is a term similar to Beer.  In other words, lots of different kinds of fish get to be called Sardines but to me and likely to most people, classic sardines are meant to be small and Brisling: The kind of fish that can be stacked two high in a can as small as a sardine can. There is another fish called the Sild harvested in Scotland that is just as or nearly as small which I suppose makes it too a classic sardine, but most of the others that we eat over here in the US are slightly larger with more dark flesh and a fishier taste.  Them are good, but these are better!!!<br /><br />In fact, these are great.  They are great because they are tiny (most are 3"" in length), of delicate white meat (with a section of dark) and a wonderfully neutral sardine flavor that pairs well with a dash of Tabasco and a Saltine.<br /><br />Even better than their flavor is the visual impact of their sleek, fat, glistening, silver-sided bodies packed end to end in their palm-sized, aluminum, pull-top can which neatly evokes the turn-key steel sardine cans of my childhood.  It's a picture almost too pure to sully with a fork or knife, luckily that ephemeral beauty remains up until the last body is pulled from the can and laid out upon its cracker and finally consumed with respectful appreciation.  Heaven."

I like them because they are always found in perfect condition in the can, with their silvery skins sparkling, and heads and tails neatly trimmed away.  The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.  Drained of oil, they are roughly 150 calories per can.  The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!  Most of the time, I decant them for draining and make an open-faced sandwich. They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.  The result is a nice midnight snack which never upsets the stomach.<br /><br />Finally, given the long shelf life, these cans of tiny fish would make a good addition to an emergency food supply.

I held out that they weren't that bad, but after forcing myself to eat them the last few days I now give up.<br /><br />But worse is the ingredients. These things pack MSG. There is no nutritional label so we don't even know the percentage of it. But it is listed as an ingredient. Now it depends on you if that is a problem or not, for me personally I want to avoid MSG so this product doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I will likely throw away the rest of what I have. It is better to go for regular jerky, which can actually be healthy. These sticks are however a different product that you have to look at carefully, and for me the taste just isn't good enough to justify eating them."

I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.

Upon the first bite I noticed it didn't have squishy fat oozing out of it like I remember these types of beef sticks having years ago when I ate them as a kid.  It had a mild pepperoni taste, not hot, not spicy.  Was that a slight hint of vinegar behind the nuance of flavor?  Had a nice, firm mouth-feel and a slight 'snap' around the edges when bitten into.  Wasn't hit with any sweet, and it certainly wasn't over salted.  Over-all, I rate this product high on the beef stick scale.  These weren't dried out, they were supple.  As a treat, I gave my dog a couple inches of it.  When his face came up to my hand and his nose hit the beef-stick, his eyes sort of rolled back in his head, Ha!

Maybe I've just become spoiled by my Amazon Prime membership but even beyond that, I'd be willing to wait a couple extra days to save the money it costs to ship these things if they shipped free.  I'm sorry but $6 to ship these had me skeptical already and that alone will probably keep me from purchasing more.  That puts the price at just under $30 and in my opinion, they are not worth that.<br /><br />Second, the taste.  To be honest, there isn't much of a difference between these and Slim Jim's.  They might be a bit less greasy, but they are practically the same shape, only shorter.  It's like someone cut a bunch of Slim Jim's into quarters and then bulked them together to make it seem like you're getting much more than you really are.  Okay, sorry, back to the taste.  They do happen to taste fairly well.  If you like Slim Jim's I can't see you not enjoying these.  Also, in terms of heat, they are not bad.  If you hate hot things then you'd probably have to eat more than a couple without drinking anything before it started to bother you and even then it wouldn't be unbearable by any means.<br /><br />Third, the texture is decent on the outside.  The skin provides that ""snap"" that most people enjoy, however the inside is, as other reviewers have described, a bit on the mushy side.  Maybe that's your thing and you enjoy that but I prefer mine a little more dense.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say 3 stars is all I'd give this product.

I originally bought the Mild flavor as a camping/hiking take along snack and it was well received by all of the adults, but none of the kids.  After our trip and running low, I bought the Pepperoni flavor which I found to be more peppery and much saltier than the Mild flavor.  While I prefer the Mild, my husband and older daughter prefer the Pepperoni.  Next flavor we will try is the hot.

I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.<br /><br />Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes."

The strange thing is that sample pack included a pack of ""Beef Sticks (didn't say mild, hot, or anything on it). These beef sticks look just like the mild beef sticks I got from Amazon.

It's true that it doesn't have that 'authentic' pepperoni taste, but in my opinion it's more than good enough. Not only that, but the people at Choo Choo snacks are generous enough to add in a sampler for some of their other products in every order. Their jerky samples taste incredible, but I'm more of a beef stick person. I like the snap that they make when you bite into them. Buffalo Bills short shots are more than worth the asking price.

I had never heard of Big Red until one of my college roommates brought some to school with him (and that has been some years ago).  At the time, I found the bubble gum taste interesting, but I didn't get a large enough sample of it to really know whether I liked it or not.  Then, several years later, some Big Red magically appeared in a local convenience store, and that is when I grew to love it.  Alas, the stuff soon disappeared off of this store's refrigerated shelves, leaving me to wonder if I would ever enjoy this unique soda drink again.  This may be a Southern product dating all the way back to 1937, but few folks here in North Carolina have ever heard of the stuff.  Maybe that will begin to change now - as long as the Big W keeps it on the shelves.  Some folks are bound to try it, if for no other reason than the price, which is significantly cheaper than all of the well-known colas.  In my opinion, the carton and bottle designs (as well as the price) actually make this look like a knock-off, discount product.  We all know how nasty those knock-off colas taste, so don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that Big Red isn't worth a try.  This stuff is all kinds of good.  It is reportedly available in 43 states now, so keep an eye out for it - or just order some from this site.<br /><br />There is one issue you need to be aware of, though.  Big Red will turn your mouth red.  That includes the lips, so guys who drink this stuff should probably take a look at themselves in the mirror before heading out for a night on the town with their buddies - unless you want to take the chance of a lipstick joke or two thrown your way.  If I drink it at night, I have to wash off my lips inside and out to avoid waking up to a pillow sporting various red stains the next morning.  It's a small price to pay, though, for something that tastes as good as Big Red."

I was born in Texas and once again as off 5 or 6 years ago I made way back here and could not have been happier to have this drink at my disposal once again. For many many years while living on the East Coast namely Maryland were this drink is not available all I could do was bring some back with me after visits to family back in the Lone Star State.<br /><br />If you want to be specific this is a cream soda, a red cream soda to be exact. But to all those saying I am not a fan of cream soda I assure you that red cream soda has a much different taste as compared to just cream soda. This wonderful drink that comes out of Waco Texas is really one of the most refreshing soft drinks I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. For all you calorie nuts out there this does have 150 worth per can of it but if you watch your intake this could be a wonderful luxury drink as my grandmother says about the Vanilla Float version of Big Red.<br /><br />If you ever come across this drink any were or order drinks from the net I highly recommend it, even if you only drink these type of drinks every so often you should at least try it. My best friend from Maryland came with me to Texas a couple of times and after trying this drink he is hooked. It is important for you to know that the guy is a mixed martial artist and does not really drink soft drinks; this would be his luxury drink."

I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.

Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year.

I think it is natural for it to drop some leaves as it acclimates to it's new environment.  The flowers are now starting to fade away with the season for gardenia plants.

But when I received, it was extremely healthy and taken care of. Only 3 leaves needed to be trimmed due to discoloration from being inside the box. I know it will take time to flwoer and won't expect it right away. My only concern is that the potting soil is not what I expected. I expected it to be softer and easier like the soil is supposed to be with bonsais, but instead it was regular soil with wood and rock in it. When I got to transplant it later on, I will be fixing that for sure because I want it to grow up healthy.<br />But it's growing quite well and nothing was broken or dead.

When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally."

However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.

Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me!

When you reach the rolling boil, steep three of the family sized teabags for about 10 seconds, then remove from heat.  Allow the bags to sit in the pot for 5-10 minutes.  Use a wooden spoon to squeeze any remaining tea out of the bags, and discard.  Allow your tea concentrate to cool to room temperature.  Pour six cups of fresh water into an empty gallon jug (preferably glass, but BPA free plastic works as well).  Then, pour your tea concentrate into the same jug.

Tinkyada pasta has a pretty strong brown rice tase and a slightly off aftertaste.  The texture is a little slippery, and it disintegrates a bit while cooking.  It's still pretty good if you serve it with a sauce that you would put on a plate of brown rice, i.e., a sauce with its own texture and assertive flavor.  It's not as good if the pasta is the star of the dish.  Of the brands I've tried, Jovial is by far the best.  The brown rice taste is minimal, even nice, and it cooks more al dente than the regular wheat American brands."
84612,84613,B000FK63IS,A2SB0OKNB1ODN5,L. A. Stanley,2,2,5,1298505600,No need to miss wheat spaghetti anymore,"I highly recommend this to anyone who eats a gluten-free diet. Other than price, it stacks up quite well to wheat spaghetti, though the taste is slightly different. My pasta-loving kids eat it happily and I can enjoy ""spaghetti night"" with them now. The texture is very good with either the normal or energy-saving cooking directions. However, I've found that there are a few things that make a difference in the final quality.<br /><br />First, regardless of which cooking method you use, after you add the pasta to the boiling water, STIR until you're sure all of the noodles are completely separated. If you don't separate them when you first add them to the boiling water, they might stick together and not cook properly. (This is true of wheat spaghetti, too, but the Tinkyada pasta seems a little more prone to it.) After they are all separate, you don't have to stir again if you're using the energy-saving method. With the normal method, I recommend a quick occasional stir to make sure none of the noodles are sticking to the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />Second, don't skimp on the rinsing. You'll see the water goes very cloudy when the pasta cooks - a lot of starch is being released into the water. You have to get that rinsed off or the pasta will stick together after you drain it. If you do the rinsing right, it won't stick together - even leftovers that have been refrigerated won't be sticky.  The cold water rinse seems to be particularly important. Since I like to serve spaghetti noodles hot, I start rinsing with cold water and then finish with hot water. The result is hot spaghetti with no stickiness.<br /><br />Third, unless you're on a low-sodium diet, I recommend salting the cooking water as directed on the package. Salting improves the taste (it's slightly sweet if you don't salt the cooking water) and it also seems to improve the texture slightly.<br /><br />About the energy-saving cooking method: This is great in the summer time since you can turn off the burner sooner and not dump as much heat into the house. But when it's time to rinse you may find that not only is the water very cloudy, but a skin of starch has developed on the surface of the water. It's not pretty, but it rinses right off. (I mentioned this because it freaked my husband out the first time he saw it; I thought I'd save someone else from that surprise.)"

It can make enjoying food a little difficult sometimes unless the texture is JUST RIGHT.<br /><br />And this pasta, in my opinion, is great.<br /><br />I cooked it according to the energy-saver directions (where you boil water, place noodles in, cook for a couple minutes and then turn OFF stove, cover and let sit for 20 minutes). The package says it can withstand a lot of overcooking, but they were a TAD mushy when made this way. They were still VERY tasty, despite being a tiny bit too soft. (I would have subtracted 1/2 star for this, but since we can't do that I decided it was still worth the 5 stars)<br /><br />It had a nice flavor too. Slightly sweet and mild, it's best when you salt the water- it balances this out nicely. The price may seem expensive to some, but my husband is very picky about pasta and usually wants us to buy a certain brand that is just about the same price as this stuff- so it's not much of a difference for us.<br /><br />MOST importantly, after eating a fair amount, I did NOT feel ""bloaty"" like I usually do after eating wheat pasta. I felt very satisfied without feeling overfull.<br /><br />I don't know, my husband is one of the pickiest eaters when it comes to pasta and even HE liked it.<br /><br />I think next time I will just cook it a little less.

As of now (August 2012), the price for a 16 oz package of spaghetti in our local health food stores is close to $5 USD.

I had already tried ""whole wheat"" pasta and even though I eat, and actually prefer, whole wheat products like pizza and breads, the TEXTURE of the spaghetti was awful. I found whole wheat egg noodles and that was better, but I missed the look and twirl of spaghetti. I saw this; I like brown rice, it's organic, it looked edible as I measured it up in my mind and, alright, I put it into my shopping cart. I followed the instructions and boiled it for 16 minutes. I rinsed it well with cold water and added it to a large hot frying pan which had olive oil. After mixing for a minute and a half, I added Lucini  brand marinara and mixed it, covered it and, when hot, ate it.

Tinkyada isn't any worse than any of the others - but I find the thickness of conventional spaghetti makes the rice taste much more noticeable.  Take this with a grain of salt, since I preferred vermicelli even before I went on a gluten-free diet (about 15 years ago), but to me, vermicelli works a lot better than conventional spaghetti, because it's thinner, making the taste (or lack thereof) less noticeable when coated with sauce.  People not on the diet notice the pasta when I use rice spaghetti, but no one has ever found fault with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLXSS"">Ener-G Foods Rice Vermicelli, 10.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I used to use, or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IAIOS"">Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> (more like linguini) I've been using in place of spaghetti recently.  I still buy the Tinkyada spaghetti to use in soups - fine for chicken noodle soup, etc. - but am going back to the above products that I've been using quite happily as spaghetti for years.  Not only is the rice taste less noticeable, but the vermicelli cooks in 4 minutes or so - 1/3 the time it takes to cook Tinkyada spaghetti.  (Given my attention span, this also makes it easier for me not to forget and overcook it into a gooey mess.)"

However, my wife is not particularly fond of this product either.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, I bought this thinking this spaghetti was going to taste exactly the same as regular pasta, but the consistancy, though constant, is kind of slimy.  Additionally, the ""energy saving method"" turns the pasta especially gooey, so I do not recommend that method of cooking should you be persuaded based on the other 25 reviews.<br /><br />There are lots of other gluten-free pastas out there, like corn-based, or a mixture of potato, soy, and rice that taste a lot closer to the ""real-thing.""

However, my 15 yo GF daughter microwaves the pasta for a couple minutes with about a TB of water and then puts them in a microwave safe dish to take to school for lunch. Just those few minutes with some extra water fixes the issue no problems.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend this pasta to anyone struggling with a gluten-free diet. This pasta absolutely replaces all gluten containing pasta's, especially with how very many varieties Tinkyada makes! No more feeling sorry for yourself or your child with yucky pasta."

This summer I treated guests from out of town to a picnic featuring pasta salad - no one guessed the dish was gluten free. I've made mac and cheese to die for! And spaghetti? Wow! Don't get me started. Don't know how they do it but this stuff beats the heck out of any gluten free pasta I've ever used. Was ready to order a couple of cases from the factory in Canada until I discovered I could order it on Amazon.

I made these terrified they would be awful, and delighted that my husband actually liked it more than regular pasta. (He doesn't have to be gluten free, so if he likes it, that's a good thing!)<br /><br />When you're cooking these, you'll notice the water gets really white, so be sure you rinse it off and they do tend to take a little longer to cook than traditional wheat pastas. When you think they are done, take a bite of them to make sure they're not too ""al dente"". Once they are cooked, they have the exact same color and texture you'd expect.<br /><br />The price here is pretty good, especially if you have to travel a distance to find them near you - if 12 is too many, split the case with a gluten free friend or two."

I even quit trying to find a good substitute for a long time. UNTIL a friend suggested I try this brand. I was skeptical, but it tasted great. It won the approval of every member of the household, even my husband who isn't gluten intolerant.<br /><br />I have tried 6 shapes of the pasta and they have all been consistently good. I can make spaghetti, mac & cheese, casseroles, lasagna and all of the other foods we used to enjoy before going GF. I follow the cooking times listed on the package, and I have never had a problem with mushiness, or the pasta being undercooked in the center. If I am going to bake the pasta after I've boiled it, I cut down on the boil time by 2-3 minutes.

So far, (and I have tried several) Tinkyada is the only GF pasta that I have found that is close in texture and fun as wheat spaghetti and I am including other pasta shapes in this review. My husband even likes it and I have served GF pasta with chicken and sauce over it to guests and they were suprised it was GF. It doesn't bloat you like wheat pasta. You just feel comforatbly full after a big wad of ""sketti"". One downside of any of the GF pastas is that they are stiff and breakable when cold so it is hard to use them for cold pasta salad. However, I had some that I had overcooked a little and that seemed to work pretty well for cold salad. You will have to experiment for yourself with that. At any rate, I would definitely suggest you try the spaghetti especially if you have a child who is gluten free. Also the pasta will make great mac and cheese."

Yep, I'm that unhappy). I cut the tape and looked inside. All of the pods were loose inside the box! They were not contained in any protective covering whatsoever. I removed the pods from the box and did locate a split plastic ziploc bag. Nothing else. It appeared as though it had no hope of keeping my product safe through the shipping process, and not just because of the split in the bag. Nope. It also was completely unsealed. I took pictures but there is no way for me to attach them to this review. The cardamom smelled musty, and I had to throw it away. I was very disappointed. I know accidents can happen, but placing my cardamom into a low quality plastic bag, failing to seal it, and tossing it into a cardboard box just doesn't cut it.

When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally."

However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.

Riley,82,83,5,1251849600,An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"

I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.

Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one.

Ol' Orville looks like a fun-loving guy, so he would agree I'm sure. Heck, he is probably living in Malibu, floating in his horizon pool with his companion Bonita...<br /><br />Started out with the smallest variety, the Ladyfinger. Tiny yellow kernels pop into tiny tender popcorns. Hardly a hull, nothing sticks in your teeth. Harder to eat because of the small size. Cute and delicious. Little kids would like this, cooked just for them.<br /><br />Next was the Baby White. These barely yellow kernels are sort of medium size and like the Ladyfinger variety have little in the way of hulls and are very tender. A quality choice and easier to eat because it pops up larger. Probably more like popcorn from the old days.<br /><br />Lastly, the Purple. Most seem to like this the best. Full size and easy to eat. Again, not too much in the way of hulls. The kernels are purple and they pop to white with purple flecks. Attractive and full size, easy to eat. Nice sort of nutty taste, although popcorn is pretty mild stuff no matter what brand you get.<br /><br />I used a Whirly Pop, a device I recommend. Coat the bottom with olive oil, almost cover the bottom with seeds, turn the heat up to around medium (not too low) and slowly turn the crank. Stop when the popping stops, as it does pretty abruptly, and pour it into a bowl. I season with sea salt and ground pepper. For the butter part, I mix about a small spoonfull of real butter with a slug or three of olive oil, heated together in the micro. Definite butter flavor without all the fat. Not a bad compromise at all.<br /><br />All varieties popped almost completely, not many duds.<br /><br />This makes a great breakfast, takes just a few minutes.<br /><br />This popcorn is advertised as from Amish country and presumably is more a traditional style of corn, maybe a heritage variety, not a genetically modified product like Orville's. This is a controversial subject, important to many people and this product is an alternative to ""Corporate Popcorn"" for them."

It popped fine with only a few un-popped kernels  and the number of old maids more numerous but also very small -- perhaps 1/3 of the number that I get with ""regular"" popcorn.  The popped kernels are about half the size of regular popcorn when popped, but the that's to be expected since they are about 1/2 the size when it starts out.  The flavor of all three varieties is good and I could tell that there were at least two different varieties based on the taste.  I could not distinguish between the three varieties visually (but I didn't do a careful inspection, I just grabbed a handful and glanced at it as I was putting it in my mouth.  I used about half a tablespoon of melted (real) butter and a decent size pinch of salt.

Flavor is good with all of the varieties, but they have their pros and cons. Baby White are very tiny and a bit hard to eat with fingers, so I ended up using a big spoon to eat (also too many unpopped kernels).  Gourmet red IS less hulls, but a bit larger than Baby White, but still too small for my tastes, but it DOES have great flavor. Gourmet White medium is an excellent choice, pops well, crunchy, flavorful, easy to pick up. My Favorite is Purple Popcorn with good sized kernels, nutty flavor almost, tender, perfection and looks good in the bowl (not that it matters).  All of their popcorn is grown so much better than conventional popcorn - no doubt due to their old-fashioned ways of farming.... thank you Amish Community for being this way. No more Jolly Time or Orville's for me.  My only negative review is that glass corn popper device they sell, does not work well in microwaves... too many un-popped kernels and if you put too much it'll burn real easy and ya end up with a very stinky microwave and kitchen UGH!  IF they know how to make it work, give very detailed instructions or discontinue."

Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird"

I am in a rural area and recently unable to find them in the local stores. I even watched a video on how to make poppadoms. Living in Florida, I knew the sun-dried aspect was obtainable. But as it is winter, I decided to wait until summer before attempting this.<br />Not wanting to wait until summer to have poppadoms with curry, I went back to searching online. As they are called many things by many different people, I now search for poppadom (yes, many different spellings), udad, papad. I was really happy to find these on Amazon.<br />These are fresh and ""bendy"", unlike the more famous brands which are truly brittle and dried out. I can almost see these by Lijjat being sun dried a few weeks before I use them. After cooking, they are larger, lighter and more crisp than the usual poppadoms, and taste wonderful.<br />I may never try to make my own, as these are probably much better than I could ever make."

We're trying to watch our weight, so these are a much tastier, lower fat, higher nutrition, version of potato crisps that you see in the stores all the time.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, I have a tough time sharing these, so the 20 pack isn't unreasonable for me. Think about it: you have a snack that's ready in seconds, and can be eaten with pickles, with chutneys, with meals, or all by itself. AND it's not dripping with fat.

No artificial colors, flavors, no sugar, and no harmful chemicals like the blue stuff, pink stuff, or yellow stuff.<br /><br />You have to know how to do it right though!<br /><br />First off, use about half of what they suggest.  You can always add more later if you want more, but with Stevia if you use too much it will taste bitter.  Some flavors require more than 1/2 strength.  With orange for example I use their recommended amounts, but the other flavors are anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended amounts.  Always start with less and add more until it tasts right for you.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a long time for it to dissolve.  Mix it in and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before trying any, and really it is best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  If you just dump some in the top and take a drink you will be VERY disappointed as it will clump and just sit there.<br /><br />We use a dispensing refrigerator container so the kids can serve themselves.

While the bitter taste known to accomplany stevia was reduced in this product, I felt that there just wasn't enough powder to make it worth the cash compared to other non-aspartame based powdered drinks out on the market.  The usage directions are abysmal on the bottle, so I went with what most people stated here and started with a small quantity of powder.  I blended it very well using a blendy bottle, which is a 28oz bottle that contains a coiled circular spring inside that slices through the water, stirring with every shake.  While I can't comment on how well it tastes if you mix and let settle for long periods of time, I never had an issue with clumping or not having enough flavor.<br /><br />As for flavors, all I bought were pretty tasty.  I ordered cherry, orange, lemon-lime, strawberry, and grape all at once when there was a decent sale going.  this was in september 2009.<br /><br />Even though you don't need much powder to get a good taste, the company doesn't give any estimation as to how much you should use or how much a bottle makes.  With that in mind at the price its at, I find it hard to give this product more than 3 stars.  If it was four dollars I'd think it was a steal and easily give another star, as I estimate each jar will make upwards of 2-3 gallons, maybe more if used sparingly. at $9.95, sorry, I just can't.  I'm back to my old ways of using a touch of stevia from packets to sweeten my water and topping it off with whichever citrus fruits are on sale (a squeeze of lemon, lime, or orange for flavor)."

You can add just a little bit and it's enough to sweeten my tea or just water. I am not a fan of drinking water (except fiji or while working out) and this can easily quench my thirst when I add the right amount. If I add too much its a mix between bitter and sweet and it's not that good. It's something I add for flavour and a great alternative for a healthy diet nut who likes tasty drinks.

Although I still like a strong dark French roast, this medium roasted Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan is now my favorite brew. The Aroma and Flavor is GREAT ! I would like to try some other roast by Cameron's, but I can't seem to make a change since I like this soooo much ! Really good coffee !

It tastes smooth and creamy, not bitter.  I prepare this coffee the same way when my parents visit and they ask, ""Why is your coffee so good?""  So I now give them bags of this coffee for gifts.

I finally did some extra searching when looking for some type of Pho base and found this. I read the reviews and ordered instantly.<br />It's so good. It's as good as our local restaurant. I followed some advice such as using less base so I made a gallon and used 4oz (5oz or half jar is what it calls for) or base and one spice packet. I let the spice packet boil for about an hour. I tasted it after the first boil as the instructions say but it didn't have as much flavor as I like.<br />My whole family loved it.<br />The only thing is I used rice stick noodles that weren't very good. I've tried thin rice noodles but those were about the same as the sticks. My local restaurant uses rice noodles that are very soft and look close to an angel hair pasta size. Maybe I'm not cooking the rice noodles long enough because they didn't get as soft as I like.

It comes with a jar of pho ""paste"" and two packets of seasoning.  I make two batches out of these and it makes a lot. I can also freeze any extra broth for later use.  I don't follow the directions regarding the onion and ginger.  I just simmer one seasoning packet for an hour to really pull out the spicy flavor, then I add half the paste mix.  Serve with the traditional pho ingredients.  YUM."

I tried five different times to make it from scratch, or from other Asian mixes, etc. and failed miserably.<br /><br />THIS IS IT! It's perfect. It tastes JUST LIKE the Pho at Pho Vung Tau... a perfect broth. JUST GREAT. With beef, chicken, or seafood, and romaine, sprouts, rice noodles plus fish, hoisin, limes and srichia (sp?) sauce, it's amazing!! I introduced this dish to my neighbors and Texas family and they're all Pho addicts now too. Especially fun with sweet fish dip and Chun's shrimp spring rolls. :) Can't say enough how great this stuff is if you love Pho and want to have it at home.<br /><br />Did I mention this is VERY YUMMY????

I bought a couple of these from a local store and have been using them last week.  Just now I notice that they have expired three months ago.  I checked the box and see no dates so I made a call to VV Foods asking why expiration is not outside on the box instead.  The lady told me that the FDA's law that they have to have an expiration date stamped on the bottom or on the lid of the jar and not the outside packaging.  Also,  it's the store's responsibility to check and rotate the products.  She then educate me that consumers have the right to open the boxes to check on expiration dates and take back to store for refund if products expired.  Uh, each box contains 2 spice packages inside and for a customer to open the boxes up just to get a non-expired product would look very weird and even a waste of time.  And really made no sense at all.<br /><br />What if you buy from online because they're not available at local stores?  I don't think it would be a problem with Amazon to refund and/or resend but if it is Amazon's responsibility to open up the packaging to check for expiration dates before sending them to their customers would cause a problem in their shipping lines."
